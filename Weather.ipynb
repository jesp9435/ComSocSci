      "The Bronx (/ðə brɒŋks/) is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Bronx County, in the U.S. state of New York. It is south of Westchester County; north and east of the New York City borough of Manhattan, across the Harlem River; and north of the New York City borough of Queens, across the East River. The Bronx is the only New York City borough not primarily located on an island. The Bronx has a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,472,654 in the 2020 census.[1] If each borough were ranked as a city, the Bronx would rank as the ninth-most-populous in the U.S. Of the five boroughs, it has the fourth-largest area, fourth-highest population, and third-highest population density.[4] The population density of the Bronx was 32,718.7 inhabitants per square mile (12,632.8/km2) in 2022, the third-highest population density of any county in the United States, behind Manhattan and Brooklyn.[5] With a population that is 54.8% Hispanic as of 2020, it is the only majority-Hispanic county in the Northeastern United States and the fourth-most-populous nationwide.[6]\n",
      "The Bronx is divided by the Bronx River into a hillier section in the west, and a flatter eastern section. East and west street names are divided by Jerome Avenue. The West Bronx was annexed to New York City in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895.[7] Bronx County was separated from New York County (modern-day Manhattan) in 1914.[8] About a quarter of the Bronx's area is open space,[9] including Woodlawn Cemetery, Van Cortlandt Park, Pelham Bay Park, the New York Botanical Garden, and the Bronx Zoo in the borough's north and center. The Thain Family Forest at the New York Botanical Garden is thousands of years old and is New York City's largest remaining tract of the original forest that once covered the city.[10] These open spaces are primarily on land reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed north and east from Manhattan.\n",
      "The word \"Bronx\" originated with Swedish-born (or Faroese-born) Jonas Bronck, who established the first European settlement in the area as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639.[11][12][13] European settlers displaced the native Lenape after 1643. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant and migrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from European countries particularly Ireland, Germany, Italy, and Eastern Europe, and later from the Caribbean region (particularly Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Haiti, Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados, and the Dominican Republic), and immigrants from West Africa (particularly from Ghana and Nigeria), African American migrants from the Southern United States, Panamanians, Hondurans, and South Asians.[14]\n",
      "The Bronx contains the poorest congressional district in the United States, New York's 15th. There are, however, some upper-income, as well as middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale, Fieldston, Spuyten Duyvil, Schuylerville, Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens, Morris Park, and Country Club.[15][16][17] Parts of the Bronx saw a steep decline in population, livable housing, and quality of life starting from the mid-to-late 1960s, continuing throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, ultimately culminating in a wave of arson in the late 1970s, a period when hip hop music evolved.[18]  The South Bronx, in particular, experienced severe urban decay. The borough began experiencing new population growth starting in the late 1990s and continuing to the present day.[19]\n",
      "The Bronx was called Rananchqua[20] by the native Siwanoy[21] band of Lenape (also known historically as the Delawares), while other Native Americans knew the Bronx as Keskeskeck.[22] It was divided by the Aquahung River (now known in English as the Bronx River).\n",
      "The Bronx was named after Jonas Bronck (c. 1600–1643), a European settler whose precise origins are disputed. Documents indicate he was a Swedish-born immigrant from Komstad, Norra Ljunga parish, in Småland, Sweden, who arrived in New Netherland during the spring of 1639.[13][23][24][25][26][27] Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the present-day Bronx and built a farm named \"Emmaus\" close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in Mott Haven.[28] He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement of New Haarlem (on Manhattan Island), and bought additional tracts from the local tribes. He eventually accumulated 500 acres (200 ha) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung, which became known as Bronck's River or the Bronx [River]. Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck's Land.[23] The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck, either Jonas Bronck's son or his younger brother, but most probably a nephew or cousin, as there was an age difference of 16 years.[29] Much work on the Swedish claim has been undertaken by Brian G.

      "The Bronx is referred to with the definite article as \"the Bronx\" or \"The Bronx\", both legally and colloquially.[31][32] The \"County of the Bronx\" also takes \"the\" immediately before \"Bronx\" in formal references, like the coextensive \"Borough of the Bronx\". The United States Postal Service uses \"Bronx, NY\" for mailing addresses.[33] The region was apparently named after the Bronx River and first appeared in the \"Annexed District of The Bronx\", created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County. It was continued in the \"Borough of The Bronx\", created in 1898, which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1895. The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers.[34][35] A time-worn story purportedly explaining the use of the definite article in the borough's name says it stems from the phrase \"visiting the Broncks\", referring to the settler's family.[36]\n",
      "The capitalization of the borough's name is sometimes disputed. Generally, the definite article is lowercase in place names (\"the Bronx\") except in some official references. The definite article is capitalized (\"The Bronx\") at the beginning of a sentence or in any other situation when a normally lowercase word would be capitalized.[37] However, some people and groups refer to the borough with a capital letter at all times, such as Bronx Borough Historian Lloyd Ultan,[38] The Bronx County Historical Society, and the Bronx-based organization Great and Glorious Grand Army of The Bronx, arguing the definite article is part of the proper name.[39][40] In particular, the Great and Glorious Grand Army of The Bronx is leading efforts to make the city refer to the borough with an uppercase definite article in all uses, comparing the lowercase article in the Bronx's name to \"not capitalizing the 's' in 'Staten Island'\".[40]\n",
      "European colonization of the Bronx began in 1639. The Bronx was originally part of Westchester County, but it was ceded to New York County in two major parts (West Bronx, 1874 and East Bronx, 1895) before it became Bronx County. Originally, the area was part of the Lenape's Lenapehoking territory inhabited by Siwanoy of the Wappinger Confederacy. Over time, European colonists converted the borough into farmlands.\n",
      "The Bronx's development is directly connected to its strategic location between New England and New York (Manhattan). Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule. The King's Bridge, built in 1693 where Broadway reached the Spuyten Duyvil Creek, was a possession of Frederick Philipse, lord of Philipse Manor.[41] Local farmers on both sides of the creek resented the tolls, and in 1759, Jacobus Dyckman and Benjamin Palmer led them in building a free bridge across the Harlem River.[42] After the American Revolutionary War, the King's Bridge toll was abolished.[43][41]\n",
      "The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County, one of the 12 original counties of the English Province of New York. The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns in Yonkers, Eastchester, and Pelham. In 1846, a new town was created by division of Westchester, called West Farms. The town of Morrisania was created, in turn, from West Farms in 1855. In 1873, the town of Kingsbridge was established within the former borders of the town of Yonkers, roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge, Riverdale, and Woodlawn Heights, and included Woodlawn Cemetery.\n",
      "Among famous settlers in the Bronx during the 19th and early 20th centuries were author Willa Cather, tobacco merchant Pierre Lorillard, and inventor Jordan L. Mott, who established Mott Haven to house the workers at his iron works.[44]\n",
      "The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages. In 1873, the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge, West Farms, and Morrisania to New York, effective in 1874; the three towns were soon abolished in the process.[45][46]\n",
      "The whole territory east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895, three years before New York's consolidation with Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. This included the Town of Westchester (which had voted against consolidation in 1894) and parts of Eastchester and Pelham.[7][45][47][48][49] The nautical community of City Island voted to join the city in 1896.[50]\n",
      "Following these two annexations, the Bronx's territory had moved from Westchester County into New York County, which already included Manhattan and the rest of pre-1874 New York City.\n",
      "On January 1, 1898, the consolidated City of New York was born, including the Bronx as one of the five distinct boroughs. However, it remained part of New York County until Bronx County was created in 1914.[51]\n",
      "On April 19, 1912, those parts of New York County which had been annexed from Westchester County in previous decades were newly constituted as Bronx County, the 62nd and last county to be created by the state, effective in 1914.[45][52] Bronx County's courts opened for business on January 2, 1914 (the same day that John P. Mitchel started work as Mayor of New York City).[8] Marble Hill, Manhattan, was now connected to the Bronx by filling in the former waterway, but it is not part of the borough or county.[53]\n",
      "The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods: a boom period during 1900–1929, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The Great Depression and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline. The mid to late century were hard times, as the Bronx changed during 1950–1985 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty in some areas. The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today.[54]\n",
      "The Bronx was a mostly rural area for many generations, with small farms supplying the city markets. In the late 19th century, however, it grew into a railroad suburb. Faster transportation enabled rapid population growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street cars to elevated railways and the subway system, which linked to Manhattan in 1904.[54]\n",
      "The South Bronx was a manufacturing center for many years and was noted as a center of piano manufacturing in the early part of the 20th century. In 1919, the Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5,000 workers.[55]\n",
      "At the end of World War I, the Bronx hosted the rather small 1918 World's Fair at 177th Street and DeVoe Avenue.[7][56]\n",
      "The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential construction.[57] Among these groups, many Irish Americans, Italian Americans, and especially Jewish Americans settled here. In addition, French, German, Polish, and other immigrants moved into the borough. As evidence of the change in population, by 1937, 592,185 Jews lived in the Bronx (43.9% of the borough's population),[58] while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011. Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx, but most have been converted to other uses.[59]\n",
      "Bootleggers and gangs were active in the Bronx during Prohibition (1920–1933). Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.[60] Police Commissioner Richard Enright said that speakeasies provided a place for \"the vicious elements, bootleggers, gamblers and their friends in all walks of life\" to cooperate and to \"evade the law, escape punishment for their crimes, [and] to deter the police from doing their duty\".[61]\n",
      "Between 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the borough's southwestern neighborhoods. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely Puerto Rican) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built to house middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today are in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough.[62]\n",
      "From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, the quality of life changed for some Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that Robert Moses' Cross Bronx Expressway destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in Robert Caro's biography The Power Broker.[63] Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of high-rise housing projects, particularly in the South Bronx.[64] Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as mortgage loans or insurance policies—a process known as redlining. Others have suggested a \"planned shrinkage\" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.[65][66][67] There was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it less profitable (or more costly) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings.[citation needed]\n",
      "In the 1970s, parts of the Bronx were plagued by a wave of arson. The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, such as the South Bronx. One explanation of this event was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money, as it was easier for them to get insurance money than to try to refurbish a dilapidated building or sell a building in a severely distressed area.[68] The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx.[69] There were cases where tenants set fire to the building they lived in so they could qualify for emergency relocations by city social service agencies to better residences, sometimes being relocated to other parts of the city.\n",
      "Out of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to arson and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 50% of their buildings meet the same fate. By the early 1980s, the Bronx was considered the most blighted urban area in the country, particularly the South Bronx which experienced a loss of 60% of the population and 40% of housing units. However, starting in the 1990s, many of the burned-out and run-down tenements were replaced by new housing units.[69]\n",
      "In May 1984, New York Supreme Court justice Peter J. McQuillan ruled that Marble Hill, Manhattan, was simultaneously part of the Borough of Manhattan (not the Borough of the Bronx) and part of Bronx County (not New York County)[70] and the matter was definitively settled later that year when the New York Legislature overwhelmingly passed legislation declaring the neighborhood part of both New York County and the Borough of Manhattan and made this clarification retroactive to 1938, as reflected on the official maps of the city.[71][72][73]\n",
      "Since the late 1980s, significant development has occurred in the Bronx, first stimulated by the city's \"Ten-Year Housing Plan\"[74][75] and community members working to rebuild the social, economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing. Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units. The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos' endeavor known as Melrose Commons[76][77][78] began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx.[79] The IRT White Plains Road Line (2 and ​5 trains) began to show an increase in riders. Chains such as Marshalls, Staples, and Target opened stores in the Bronx. More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole (rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007), although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods, while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs.[80][81][82][full citation needed][83]\n",
      "In 1997, the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League, acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century.[84] In 2006, The New York Times reported that \"construction cranes have become the borough's new visual metaphor, replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings.\"[85] The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002. Between 2002 and June 2007, 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $4.8 billion has been invested in new housing. In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed. Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx.[86]\n",
      "In addition there came a revitalization of the existing housing market in areas such as Hunts Point, the Lower Concourse, and the neighborhoods surrounding the Third Avenue Bridge as people buy apartments and renovate them.[87] Several boutique and chain hotels opened in the 2010s in the South Bronx.[88]\n",
      "New developments are underway. The Bronx General Post Office[89][90] on the corner of the Grand Concourse and East 149th Street is being converted into a market place, boutiques, restaurants and office space with a USPS concession.[91] The Kingsbridge Armory, often cited as the largest armory in the world, is currently slated for redevelopment.\n",
      "Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College. The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m2) of development and would cost US$350–500 million.[92]\n",
      "Despite significant investment compared to the post war period, many exacerbated social problems remain including high rates of violent crime, substance abuse, overcrowding, and substandard housing conditions.[93][94][95][96] The Bronx has the highest rate of poverty in New York City, and the greater South Bronx is the poorest area.[97][98]\n",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Bronx County has a total area of 57 square miles (150 km2), of which 42 square miles (110 km2) is land and 15 square miles (39 km2) (27%) is water.[99]\n",
      "The Bronx is New York City's northernmost borough, New York State's southernmost mainland county and the only part of New York City that is almost entirely on the North American mainland, unlike the other four boroughs that are either islands or located on islands.[100] The bedrock of the West Bronx is primarily Fordham gneiss, a high-grade heavily banded metamorphic rock containing significant amounts of pink feldspar.[101] Marble Hill – politically part of Manhattan but now physically attached to the Bronx – is so-called because of the formation of Inwood marble there as well as in Inwood, Manhattan, and parts of the Bronx and Westchester County.\n",

      "The Hudson River separates the Bronx on the west from Alpine, Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, New Jersey; the Harlem River separates it from the island of Manhattan to the southwest; the East River separates it from Queens to the southeast; and to the east, Long Island Sound separates it from Nassau County in western Long Island. Directly north of the Bronx are (from west to east) the adjoining Westchester County communities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Pelham Manor and New Rochelle. There is also a short southern land boundary with Marble Hill in the Borough of Manhattan, over the filled-in former course of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek; Marble Hill's postal ZIP code, telephonic area codes and fire service, however, are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan.[53]The Bronx River flows south from Westchester County through the borough, emptying into the East River; it is the only entirely freshwater river in New York City.[102] It separates the West Bronx from the schist of the East Bronx. A smaller river, the Hutchinson River (named after the religious leader Anne Hutchinson, killed along its banks in 1641), passes through the East Bronx and empties into Eastchester Bay.\n",
      "The Bronx also includes several small islands in the East River and Long Island Sound, such as City Island and Hart Island. Rikers Island in the East River, home to the large jail complex for the entire city, is also part of the Bronx.\n",
      "The Bronx's highest elevation at 280 feet (85 m) is in the northwest corner, west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School.[103] The opposite (southeastern) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or \"necks\" of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once salt marsh: Hunt's Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck and Throggs Neck. Further up the coastline, Rodman's Neck lies between Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island. The Bronx's irregular shoreline extends for 75 square miles (194 km2).[104]\n",
      "Although Bronx County was the third most densely populated county in the United States in 2022 (after Manhattan and Brooklyn),[5] 7,000 acres (28 km2) of the Bronx—about one fifth of the Bronx's area, and one quarter of its land area—is given over to parkland.[9][107] The vision of a system of major Bronx parks connected by park-like thoroughfares is usually attributed to John Mullaly.\n",
      "Woodlawn Cemetery, located on 400 acres (160 ha) and one of the largest cemeteries in New York City, sits on the western bank of the Bronx River near Yonkers. It opened in 1863, in what was then the town of Yonkers, at the time a rural area. Since the first burial in 1865, more than 300,000 people have been interred there.[108]\n",
      "The borough's northern side includes the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park, which includes Orchard Beach—and the third-largest, Van Cortlandt Park, which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers.[109] Also in the northern Bronx, Wave Hill, the former estate of George W. Perkins—known for a historic house, gardens, changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks the New Jersey Palisades from a promontory on the Hudson in Riverdale. Nearer the borough's center, and along the Bronx River, is Bronx Park; its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens, which preserve the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the county, and its southern end the Bronx Zoo, the largest urban zoological gardens in the United States.[110] In 1904 the Chestnut Blight pathogen (Cryphonectria parasitica) was found for the first time outside of Asia, here, at the Bronx Zoo.[111] Over the next 40 years it spread throughout eastern North America and killed back essentially every American Chestnut (Castanea dentata), causing ecological and economic devastation.[111]\n",
      "Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir, surrounded by 2 miles (3 km) of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood; the reservoir was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack.[112] Further south is Crotona Park, home to a 3.3-acre (1.3 ha) lake, 28 species of trees, and a large swimming pool.[113] The land for these parks, and many others, was bought by New York City in 1888, while land was still open and inexpensive, in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development.[114]\n",
      "Some of the acquired land was set aside for the Grand Concourse and Pelham Parkway, the first of a series of boulevards and parkways (thoroughfares lined with trees, vegetation and greenery). Later projects included the Bronx River Parkway, which developed a road while restoring the riverbank and reducing pollution, Mosholu Parkway and the Henry Hudson Parkway.\n",
      "In 2006, a five-year, $220-million program of capital improvements and natural restoration in 70 Bronx parks was begun (financed by water and sewer revenues) as part of an agreement that allowed a water filtration plant under Mosholu Golf Course in Van Cortlandt Park. One major focus is on opening more of the Bronx River's banks and restoring them to a natural state.[115]\n",

      "There are two primary systems for dividing the Bronx into regions, which do not necessarily agree with one another. One system is based on the Bronx River, while the other strictly separates South Bronx from the rest of the borough.\n",
      "The Bronx River divides the borough nearly in half, putting the earlier-settled, more urban, and hillier sections in the western lobe and the newer, more suburban coastal sections in the eastern lobe. It is an accurate reflection on the Bronx's history considering that the towns that existed in the area prior to annexation to the City of New York generally did not straddle the Bronx River.[citation needed] In addition, what is today the Bronx was annexed to New York City in two stages: areas west of the Bronx River were annexed in 1874 while areas to the east of the river were annexed in 1895.[citation needed]\n",

The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent. People of Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9% of the population. People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1% of the population. German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4% and 0.8% of the population respectively. The Bronx has the largest Albanian community in the United States.[140] As of 2018, non-Hispanic White people account for about one in seven residents (14.9% in 2018).[132]\n",
      "The Census of 1930 counted only 1.0% (12,930) of the Bronx's population as Negro (while making no distinct counts of Hispanic or Spanish-surname residents).[141]\n",

      "The Bronx's recognition as an important center of African-American culture has led Fordham University to establish the Bronx African-American History Project (BAAHP).[148]\n",
      "The Bronx has had a long association with music. In the early 19th century, it was a center for the evolution of Latin jazz.[citation needed] The Bronx Opera was founded in the 1960s.[citation needed]\n",
      "In the 1970s, The Bronx was strongly associated with the development of hip hop music. One of the genre's pioneers, DJ Kool Herc, held parties in the community room of an apartment building at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, where he experimented with turntablist techniques such as mixing and scratching of funk records, as well as rapping during extended instrumentals.[149][150][151] Other significant Bronx DJs from this period include Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa.[citation needed].\n",

      "The Bronx is the home of the New York Yankees, nicknamed \"the Bronx Bombers\", of Major League Baseball.[152] The original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home the first of their 27 World Series championships; with seating for 58,000 in three decks, it was the largest MLB statdium of its day.[153] With the famous façade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Thurman Munson, Don Mattingly, Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.[154]\n",
      "The original stadium was the scene of Lou Gehrig's Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the New York Giants of the National Football League from 1956 to 1973. It would be renovated during the Yankees' 1974 and 1975 seasons, while they played at Shea Stadium in Queens, then the home stadium of the New York Mets; the refurbished Yankee Stadium opened in 1976, and saw its first three seasons end in World Series appearances (a loss in 1976, and wins in 1977 and 1978).\n",
      "The original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new Yankee Stadium in which the team started play in 2009. It is north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park.[155] The current Yankee Stadium is also the home of New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who began play in 2015.[156]\n",
      "The Yankees won 26 World Series titles while playing at the first Yankee Stadium; they added a 27th in 2009 at the end of their first season in their current home.[157]\n",
      "The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The Pregones Theater, which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However, rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.\n",
      "The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, founded in 1998 by Arthur Aviles and Charles Rice-Gonzalez, provides dance, theatre and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary and modern art in relation to race, gender and sexuality. It is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company, and the Bronx Dance Coalition. The academy was formerly in the American Bank Note Company Building before relocating to a venue on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church.[158]\n",
      "The Bronx Museum of the Arts, founded in 1971, exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) of galleries. Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent an expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica that would double the museum's size to 33,000 square feet (3,100 m2).[159]\n",
      "The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of the \"Heinrich Heine Memorial\", better known as the Lorelei Fountain. After Heine's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected, allegedly for antisemitic motives, a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet (1797–1856), his incensed German-American admirers, including Carl Schurz, started a movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan, at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art.[160] In 1899, the memorial by Ernst Gustav Herter was placed in Joyce Kilmer Park, near the Yankee Stadium. In 1999, it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse.\n",
      "The peninsular borough's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways. The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder. The state's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler (on the southeastern shore) houses the Maritime Industry Museum.[161] In addition, the Harlem River is reemerging as \"Scullers' Row\"[162] due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project,[163] a joint public-private endeavor of the city's parks department. Canoeing and kayaking on the borough's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance. The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens, its neighbor, the Bronx Zoo, and a little further south, on the west shore, Bronx River Art Center.[164]\n",
      "\"Bronx Week\", traditionally held in May, began as a one-day celebration. Begun by Bronx historian Lloyd Ultan and supported by then borough president Robert Abrams, the original one-day program was based on the \"Bronx Borough Day\" festival which took place in the 1920s. The following year, at the height of the decade's civil unrest, the festival was extended to a one-week event. In the 1980s the key event, the \"Bronx Ball\", was launched. The week includes the Bronx Week Parade as well as inductions into the \"Bronx Walk of Fame.\"[165]\n",
      "Various Bronx neighborhoods conduct their own community celebrations. The Arthur Avenue \"Little Italy\" neighborhood conducts an annual Autumn Ferragosto Festival that celebrates Italian culture.[166] Hunts Point hosts an annual \"Fish Parade and Summer Festival\" at the start of summer.[167] Edgewater Park hosts an annual \"Ragamuffin\" children's walk in November.[168] There are several events to honor the borough's veterans.[169] Albanian Independence Day is also observed.[170]\n",

      "The Bronx has several local newspapers, including The Bronx Daily, The Bronx News,[174] Parkchester News, City News, The Norwood News, The Riverdale Press, Riverdale Review, The Bronx Times Reporter, and Co-op City Times. Four non-profit news outlets, Norwood News, Mount Hope Monitor, Mott Haven Herald and The Hunts Point Express serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press, Bernard Stein, won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959.)\n",
      "The Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, The Bronx Home News, which started publishing on January 20, 1907, and merged into the New York Post in 1948. It became a special section of the Post, sold only in the Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view.\n",
      "One of New York City's major non-commercial radio broadcasters is WFUV, a National Public Radio-affiliated 50,000-watt station broadcasting from Fordham University's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna was relocated to the top an apartment building owned by Montefiore Medical Center, which expanded the reach of the station's signal.[175]\n",
      "The City of New York has an official television station run by NYC Media and broadcasting from Bronx Community College, and Cablevision operates News 12 The Bronx, both of which feature programming based in the Bronx. Co-op City was the first area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond Manhattan, to have its own cable television provider. The local public-access television station BronxNet originates from Herbert H. Lehman College, the borough's only four year CUNY school, and provides government-access television (GATV) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents.[176]\n",
      "Shopping malls and markets in the Bronx include:\n",
      "Prominent shopping areas in the Bronx include Fordham Road, Bay Plaza in Co-op City, The Hub, the Riverdale/Kingsbridge shopping center, and Bruckner Boulevard. Shops are also concentrated on streets aligned underneath elevated railroad lines, including Westchester Avenue, White Plains Road, Jerome Avenue, Southern Boulevard, and Broadway. The Bronx Terminal Market contains several big-box stores, which opened in 2009 south of Yankee Stadium.\n",
      "The Bronx has three primary shopping centers: The Hub, Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard. The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District (B.I.D.), in The Hub, is the retail heart of the South Bronx, where four roads converge: East 149th Street, Willis, Melrose and Third Avenues.[177] It is primarily inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven.[178] The Hub has been called \"the Broadway of the Bronx\", being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx.[179] It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density. In configuration, it resembles a miniature Times Square, a spatial \"bow-tie\" created by the geometry of the street.[180] The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1.\n",
      "The Bronx Terminal Market, in the West Bronx, formerly known as Gateway Center, is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space, built on a 17 acres (7 ha) site that formerly held a wholesale fruit and vegetable market also named Bronx Terminal Market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention, south of Yankee Stadium. The $500 million shopping center, which was completed in 2009, saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings, one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market. The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars. The center's design has earned it a LEED \"Silver\" designation.[181]\n",
      "Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, the New York City Charter that provides for a \"strong\" mayor–council system has governed the Bronx. The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in the Bronx.\n",
      "The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate, which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court's 1964 \"one man, one vote\" decision.[182]\n",
      "Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations.\n",
      "Until March 1, 2009, the Borough President of the Bronx was Adolfo Carrión Jr., elected as a Democrat in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy. His successor, Democratic New York State Assembly member Rubén Díaz, Jr. — after winning a special election on April 21, 2009, by a vote of 86.3% (29,420) on the \"Bronx Unity\" line to 13.3% (4,646) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello on the \"People First\" line,[183][184] — became Borough President on May 1, 2009. In 2021, Rubén Díaz's Democratic successor, Vanessa Gibson was elected (to begin serving in 2022) with 79.9% of the vote against 13.4% for Janell King (Republican) and 6.5% for Sammy Ravelo (Conservative).\n",
      "All of the Bronx's currently elected public officials have first won the nomination of the Democratic Party (in addition to any other endorsements). Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Controversial political issues in the Bronx include environmental issues, the cost of housing, and annexation of parkland for new Yankee Stadium.[185]\n",
      "Since its separation from New York County on January 1, 1914, the Bronx, has had, like each of the other 61 counties of New York State, its own criminal court system[8] and District Attorney, the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. Darcel D. Clark has been the Bronx County District Attorney since 2016. Her predecessor was Robert T. Johnson, the District Attorney from 1989 to 2015. He was the first African-American District Attorney in New York State.[186]\n",
      "The Bronx also has twelve Community Boards, appointed bodies that advise on land use and municipal facilities and services for local residents, businesses and institutions.\n",
      "After becoming a separate county in 1914, the Bronx has supported only two Republican presidential candidates. It voted heavily for the winning Republican Warren G. Harding in 1920, but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor Calvin Coolidge in 1924 (Coolidge 79,562; John W. Davis, Dem., 72,834; Robert La Follette, 62,202 equally divided between the Progressive and Socialist lines).\n",
      "Since then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for president, starting with a vote of 2–1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 1928, followed by four 2–1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. Thomas E. Dewey won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. Harry Truman, the winning Democrat, and 17% for Henry A. Wallace of the Progressives. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, Charles Evans Hughes, had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow Wilson's 49.8% and Socialist candidate Allan Benson's 7.3%.)[191]\n",
      "As of 2023, four Democrats represented the Bronx in the United States House of Representatives: [192]\n",
      "The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor. The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933, 1937, and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican).[193] The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudy Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005. The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John Purroy Mitchel, who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit citywide by 23.2% to 21.7%.[194]\n",
      "Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions, many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx. The New York City Department of Education manages the borough's public noncharter schools.[195] In 2000, public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx's residents over three years old (out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools).[196] There are also several public charter schools. Private schools range from elite independent schools to religiously affiliated schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Jewish organizations.\n",
      "A small portion of land between Pelham and Pelham Bay Park, with 35 houses, is a part of the Bronx, but is cut off from the rest of the borough due to the county boundaries; the New York City government pays for the residents' children to go to Pelham Union Free School District schools, including Pelham Memorial High School, since that is more cost effective than sending school buses to take the students to New York City schools. This arrangement has been in place since 1948.[197]\n",
      "In 2000, according to the United States Census, out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old, 62.3% had graduated from high school and 14.6% held a bachelor's or higher college degree. These percentages were lower than those for New York's other boroughs, which ranged from 68.8% (Brooklyn) to 82.6% (Staten Island) for high school graduates over 24, and from 21.8% (Brooklyn) to 49.4% (Manhattan) for college graduates.

      "The Bronx street grid is irregular. Like the northernmost part of upper Manhattan, the West Bronx's hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid. Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx. This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of Westchester County west of the Bronx River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside.\n",
      "The East Bronx is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to be more regular. Only the Wakefield neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a misalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.\n",

      "Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled, working-class, urban culture. From This Day Forward (1946), set in Highbridge, occasionally delved into Bronx life. The most notable examinations of working class Bronx life were Paddy Chayefsky's Academy Award-winning Marty[210] and his 1956 film The Catered Affair. Other films that portrayed life in the Bronx are: the 1993 Robert De Niro/Chazz Palminteri film, A Bronx Tale, Spike Lee's 1999 movie Summer of Sam, which focused on an Italian-American Bronx community in the 1970s, 1994's I Like It Like That which takes place in the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of the South Bronx, and Doughboys, the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts.\n",
      "The Bronx's gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with depictions of the \"Bronx cheer\", a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, allegedly first made by New York Yankees fans. The sound can be heard, for example, on the Spike Jones and His City Slickers recording of \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (from the 1942 Disney animated film of the same name), repeatedly lambasting Adolf Hitler with: \"We'll Heil! (Bronx cheer) Heil! (Bronx cheer) Right in Der Fuehrer's Face!\"[211][212]\n",
      "Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, and urban ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that \"The Bronx is burning\": in 1974 it was the title of both an editorial in The New York Times and a BBC documentary film.[213] The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series, when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning\". Historians of New York City often point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.[214] A feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagán called Bronx Burning chronicled what led up to the many arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.[215][216]\n",
      "Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film The Warriors, the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn. A Bronx Tale (1993) depicts gang activities in the Belmont \"Little Italy\" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and \"Gunhill\" (a play off the name Gun Hill Road). This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning, an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series (2007) about the New York Yankees' drive to winning baseball's 1977 World Series. The TV series emphasizes the team's boisterous nature, led by manager Billy Martin, catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson, as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of Ed Koch as mayor.\n",
      "The 1981 film Fort Apache, The Bronx is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed \"Fort Apache\". Also from 1981 is the horror film Wolfen making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. Knights of the South Bronx, a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film Fuga dal Bronx, also known as Bronx Warriors 2 and Escape 2000, an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, \"Leave the Bronx!\" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in Queens, substituting as the Bronx. Rumble in the Bronx, filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. Last Bronx, a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant. The 2016 Netflix series The Get Down is based on the development of hip hop in 1977 in the South Bronx.[217]\n",
      "The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in Herman Wouk's City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. Kate Simon's Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood (1982) is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue.[218] In Jacob M. Appel's short story, \"The Grand Concourse\" (2007),[219] a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in Avery Corman's book The Old Neighborhood (1980),[220] an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood (Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.\n",
      "By contrast, Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities (1987)[221] portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the Bruckner Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, The New York Times reported that \"the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.\" In the same article, the Reverend Al Sharpton (whose fictional analogue in the novel is \"Reverend Bacon\") asserts that \"twenty years later, the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe's wardrobe.\"[222]\n",

      "Co-op City (short for Cooperative City) is a cooperative housing development located in the northeast section of the borough of the Bronx in New York City. It is bounded by Interstate 95 to the southwest, west, and north and the Hutchinson River Parkway to the east and southeast, and is partially in the Baychester and Eastchester neighborhoods. With 43,752 residents as of the 2010 United States Census,[2] it is the largest housing cooperative in the world.[3] It is in New York City Council District 12.\n",
      "Co-op City was formerly marshland before being occupied by an amusement park called Freedomland U.S.A. from 1960 to 1964. Construction began in 1966 and the first residents moved in two years later, though the project was not completed until 1973. The construction of the community was sponsored by the United Housing Foundation and financed with a mortgage loan from New York State Housing Finance Agency.\n",
      "The community is part of Bronx Community District 10 and its ZIP Code is 10475. Nearby attractions include Pelham Bay Park, Orchard Beach and City Island.\n",
      "Co-op City's 15,372 residential units are composed of 35 high-rise buildings and seven clusters of townhouses, making it the largest residential development in the United States.[4] It sits on 320 acres (1.3 km2), though only 20% of the land was developed, leaving many green spaces. The apartment buildings range from 24 to 33 floors. There are four types of buildings: 10 Triple Core (26 stories high with 500 apartment units per building), 10 chevron (24 stories, 414 units), 15 tower (33 stories, 384 units), and 236 town houses. The townhouses are three stories high and have a separate garden apartment and upper duplex apartment.[5]\n",
      "This \"city within a city\" also has eight parking garages, three shopping centers, a 25-acre (100,000 m2) educational park, including a high school, two middle schools, and three grade schools. More than 40 offices are rented by doctors, lawyers, and other professionals, and there are 15 houses of worship. Spread throughout the community are six nursery schools and day care centers, four basketball courts, and five baseball diamonds. The adjacent Bay Plaza Shopping Center has a 13-screen multiplex movie theater, department stores, and a supermarket.\n",
      "The development was built on landfill, and the original marshland still surrounds it. The building foundations extend down to bedrock through 50,000 pilings,[6] but the land surrounding Co-op's structures settles and sinks a fraction of an inch each year, creating cracks in sidewalks and entrances to buildings.[7]\n",
      "Most streets in the community are named after notable historical personalities. Generally, streets in section one begin with the letter \"D\", section two begins with the letter \"C\", section three with the letter \"A\", section four with the letter \"B\" and section five with the letter \"E\".[8]\n",

      "The land north of the Hutchinson River Parkway was a large swampy area known by residents as \"the dump\", and most of the land on the north side of the Hutchinson River was flat land used for recreation.\n",
      "The land to the south of the Hutchinson River (now Section 5 of Co-op City) was swampland. A tidal estuary reached from the Hutchinson River at the New Haven Railroad along a route just north of Hunter and Boller Avenue to pass under the Hutchinson River Parkway. The estuary was the site of boat yards and canoe rental sites during the 1950s. \n",
      "The northern portion of the site became the home of a 205-acre theme park named Freedomland U.S.A. Freedomland operated from June 19, 1960[10] until September 1964, when it closed after going bankrupt.[11][12] A small portion of the former park site at the northeast corner of Bartow and Baychester Avenues in Co-op City remains zoned as a C7 district,[13] reserved \"for large open amusement parks\".[14] The zoning district is a holdover from Freedomland's operation.[15][16]\n",
      "In February 1965, plans were announced for the residential Co-op City development, the world's largest housing cooperative, on the site.[17] The plans for Co-op City were announced in May 1965, with no provisions for an amusement park.[18] Construction on Co-op City began in May 1966.[19] While much of the Freedomland site and some of the surrounding land was infilled, several existing houses were retained along Givans Creek (near Section 5 of Co-op City) because of opposition from residents there. These houses received sewage and other utilities, though these projects were delayed. There was a controversy when Co-op City builders filled the land to grade, because the existing houses were located as much as 12 feet (3.7 m) below grade, and filling for the main development caused storm runoff to flood the existing houses.[20]\n",
      "Residents began moving in during December 1968,[21] and construction was completed in 1973. The project was sponsored and built by the United Housing Foundation, an organization established in 1951 by Abraham Kazan and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and was designed by cooperative architect Herman J. Jessor. The name of the complex's corporation itself was later changed to RiverBay at Co-op City.\n",
      "The construction of the community was financed with a mortgage loan from New York State Housing Finance Agency (HFA). The complex defaulted on the loan in 1975 and has had ongoing agreements to pay back HFA.\n",
      "Mismanagement, shoddy construction, and corruption led to the community's defaulting on its loan in 1975. The original Kazan board resigned, and the state took over control. Cooperators, faced with a 25-percent increase in their monthly maintenance fees, organized residents to refuse to pay their monthly maintenance fees. New York State threatened to foreclose on the property and evict the residents, which would mean the loss of their equity. However, cooperators stayed united and held out for 13 months (the longest and largest strike of its kind in United States history) before a compromise was finally reached, with mediation from then-Bronx Borough President Robert Abrams and then-New York Secretary of State Mario Cuomo. Cooperators would remit $20 million in back payments of maintenance fees, but they would get to take over management of the complex and set their own fees.[22]\n",
      "The shares of stock that prospective purchasers bought to enable them to occupy Co-op City apartments became the subject of protracted litigation, culminating in a United States Supreme Court decision United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837 (1975).[23] 57 residents sued because they had been charged for costs that were not described in a 1965 Information Bulletin seeking to attract residents for apartments in Co-op City. The Supreme Court held that federal courts have no jurisdiction of shares of stock that allow the purchaser to live in an apartment in Co-op City because they are not federally-regulated shares of commercial stock.[24]\n",
      "In 2004, Co-op City was financially unable to continue payments to HFA due to the huge costs of emergency repairs. New York Community Bank helped RiverBay satisfy its $57 million mortgage obligation, except for $95 million in arrears, by refinancing the loan later that same year. This led to the agreement that Co-op City would remain in the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program for at least seven more years as a concession on the arrears and that any rehabilitation that Co-op City took on to improve the original poor construction (which happened under New York State's watch) would earn credit toward eliminating the debt. By 2008, RiverBay had submitted enough proof of construction repairs to pay off the balance of arrears to New York State.\n",
      "Within the first decade of the 2000s, the aging development began undergoing a complex-wide $240 million renovation, replacing piping and garbage compactors, rehabilitating garages and roofs, upgrading the power plant, making facade and terrace repairs, switching to energy-efficient lighting and water-conserving technologies, replacing all 130,000 windows and 4,000 terrace doors (costing $57.9 million in material and labor) and all 179 elevators. The word \"renaissance\" is being used to describe this period in Co-op City history. Many of these efforts are also helping in the \"greening\" of the complex: the power-plant will be less polluting, the buildings will be more efficient and recycling efforts will become more extensive. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) awarded its largest ever grant—$5.2 million—to the community under its NY Energy $mart Assisted Multifamily Program.\n",
      "In 2003, after a partial collapse in one garage, inspectors found 5 of the 8 garages to be unsafe and ordered them closed for extensive repairs. The other 3 garages were able to remain partially open during repairs. To deal with the parking crisis, New York City allowed angled parking in the community, the large greenways in the complex were paved over to make outdoor parking lots and agreements were made with nearby shopping centers to use their extra parking spaces. All garages were re-opened by January 2008, and work began to restore the greenways that had been paved.\n",
      "Financial responsibility for these upgrades was the subject of a protracted dispute between RiverBay and the State of New York.[25] Co-op City was developed under New York's Mitchell-Lama Program, which subsidizes affordable housing. RiverBay charged that the state should help with the costs because of severe infrastructure failures stemming from the development's original shoddy construction, which occurred under the supervision of the state. The state countered that RiverBay was responsible for the costs because of its lack of maintenance over the years. In the end, a compromise had the state supplying money and RiverBay refinancing the mortgage, borrowing $480 million from New York Community Bank in 2004, to cover the rest of the capital costs.[26]\n",
      "In 2007, the power plant was in the process of upgrading from solely managing the electricity brought in from Con Edison to a 40-megawatt tri-generation facility with the ability to use oil, gas or steam (depending on market conditions) to power turbines to produce its own energy. The final cost of this energy independence could be as much as $90 million, but it is hoped to pay for itself with the savings earned—with conservative estimates at $18 million annually—within several years. Also, whatever excess power generated after satisfying the community's needs will be sold back to the electrical grid, adding another source of income for RiverBay.\n",
      "In September 2007, a report by the New York Inspector General, Kristine Hamann, charged that the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which is responsible for overseeing Mitchell-Lama developments, was negligent in its duties to supervise the contracting, financial reporting, budgeting and the enforcement of regulations in Co-op City (and other M-L participants) during the period of January 2003 to October 2006. The report also chided Marion Scott management for trying to influence the RiverBay Board by financing election candidates and providing jobs and sports tickets to Board members and their family/friends—all violations of DHCR and/or RiverBay regulations. The DHCR was instructed to overhaul its system of oversight to better protect the residents and taxpayer money.[27]\n",
      "In October 2007, a former board president, Iris Herskowitz Baez, and a former painting contractor, Nickhoulas Vitale, pleaded guilty to involvement in a kickback scheme. While on the RiverBay Board, Baez steered $3.5 million in subsidized painting contracts for needed work in Co-op City apartments, to Vitale's company, Stadium Interior Painting, in exchange for $100,000 in taxpayer money.[28] Herskowitz Baez was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 12 months' probation and given a $10,000 fine in March 2008.[29]\n",

      "As a result of the continued presence of the amusement park zoning lot at Bartow and Baychester Avenues, there were no restrictions on the heights of signs on that lot. In late 2017, the site's owner began erecting tall LED billboards on the lot, a move opposed by Co-op City residents since one of the billboards faced Co-op City, keeping residents awake at night.[34] The following year, residents proposed changing the lot's zoning to a standard commercial use.[35][16] A tall wind turbine was erected on the lot in December 2019.[36] The turbine toppled later that month, knocking down the billboard, but causing no injuries.[36][37]\n",

A small nature preserve called the Givans Creek Woods is located at the northern portion of Co-op City, near the intersection of Baychester Avenue and Co-op City Boulevard.[62] Despite its name, which is derived from Scottish immigrant Robert Givan, it is located above Rattlesnake Creek.[63]\n",

      "Yankee Stadium is a baseball stadium located in the Bronx in New York City. The stadium is the home ballpark for Major League Baseball’s New York Yankees as well as the home venue for New York City FC of Major League Soccer.\n",
      "The stadium opened in April 2009, replacing the original Yankee Stadium that operated from 1923 to 2008; it is situated on the 24-acre (9.7 ha) former site of Macombs Dam Park, one block north of the original stadium's site. The new Yankee Stadium replicates design elements of the original Yankee Stadium, including its exterior and trademark frieze, while incorporating larger spaces and modern amenities. It has the sixth-largest seating capacity among the 30 stadiums of Major League Baseball.\n",
      "Construction on the stadium began in August 2006, and the project spanned many years and faced many controversies, including the high public cost and the loss of public park land. The $2.3 billion stadium was built with $1.2 billion in public subsidies[7] and is one of the most expensive stadiums ever built.[25]\n",
      "Yankee Stadium became the home field of the MLS expansion club New York City FC in 2014, which is owned by City Football Group and the Yankees. It will be an interim venue for the club until a soccer-specific stadium is constructed. It has also occasionally hosted college football games, including the annual Pinstripe Bowl, concerts, and other athletic and entertainment events.\n",
      "New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner began campaigning for a new stadium in the early 1980s, just a few years after the remodeled Yankee Stadium opened. Steinbrenner at the time was reportedly considering a move to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean in 1984 authorized the use of land for a new baseball stadium in the Meadowlands, but the state legislature did not provide financing for the stadium.[26] In a statewide referendum in 1987, New Jersey taxpayers rejected $185 million in public financing for a baseball stadium for the Yankees.[27] Despite the rejection from New Jersey, Steinbrenner frequently threatened to move as leverage in negotiations with New York City.\n",
      "In 1988, Mayor Ed Koch agreed to have city taxpayers spend $90 million on a second renovation of Yankee Stadium that included luxury boxes and restaurants inside the stadium and parking garages and traffic improvements outside. Steinbrenner agreed in principle, but then backed out of the deal. In 1993, Mayor David Dinkins expanded on Koch's proposal by offering his Bronx Center vision for the neighborhood, including new housing, a new courthouse, and relocating the Police Academy nearby.[28]\n",
      "In 1993, New York Governor Mario Cuomo proposed using the West Side Yard, a 30-acre (12 ha) rail yard along the West Side of Manhattan and owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as the location for a new stadium for the Yankees. However, Cuomo lost his re-election bid a few months later. By 1995, Steinbrenner had rejected 13 proposals to keep the Yankees in the Bronx.[29]\n",
      "In 1998, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer proposed spending $600 million in public money to add dozens of luxury boxes to the stadium, to improve highway and public transportation access, and to create a Yankee Village, with shops, restaurants, and a museum. Steinbrenner rejected this as well. That same year, Mayor Rudy Giuliani unveiled a plan to relocate the Yankees to the West Side Yard for a $1 billion stadium. However, with most of the funding coming from taxpayers, Giuliani tabled the proposal, fearing rejection in a citywide referendum. The West Side Stadium plan resurfaced in December 2001, and by January 2002, months after the September 11 attacks, Giuliani announced \"tentative agreements\" for both the New York Yankees and New York Mets to build new stadiums. He estimated that both stadiums would cost $2 billion, with city and state taxpayers contributing $1.2 billion.[30]\n",
      "Michael Bloomberg, who succeeded Giuliani as mayor in 2002, called the former mayor's agreements \"corporate welfare\" and exercised the escape clause in the agreements to back out of both deals, saying that the city could not afford to build new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets. Bloomberg said that Giuliani had inserted a clause in this deal that loosened the teams' leases with the city and would allow the Yankees and Mets to leave the city on 60 days' notice to find a new home elsewhere if the city backed out of the agreement. At the time, Bloomberg said that publicly funded stadiums were a poor investment. Bloomberg's blueprint for the stadium was unveiled in 2004, at the same time as the plan for the Mets' new stadium, Citi Field. The final cost for the two stadiums was more than $3.1 billion; taxpayer subsidies accounted for $1.8 billion.[7]\n",
      "Groundbreaking ceremonies for the stadium took place on August 16, 2006, the 58th anniversary of Babe Ruth's death, with Steinbrenner, Bloomberg, and then-Governor of New York George Pataki among the notables donning Yankees hard hats and wielding ceremonial shovels to mark the occasion.[31][32] The Yankees continued to play in the previous Yankee Stadium during the 2007 and 2008 seasons while their new home stadium was built across the street. The community was left without parkland for five years.\n",
      "During construction of the new stadium, a construction worker and avid Boston Red Sox fan buried a replica jersey of Red Sox player David Ortiz underneath the visitors' dugout with the objective of placing a \"hex\" on the Yankees, much like the \"Curse of the Bambino\" that had allegedly plagued the Red Sox long after trading Ruth to the Yankees. After the worker was exposed by co-workers, he was forced to help exhume the jersey.[33] The Yankees organization then donated the retrieved jersey to the Jimmy Fund, a charity started in 1948 by the Red Sox' National League rivals, the Boston Braves, but long championed by the Red Sox and particularly associated with Ted Williams.[34][35] The worker has since claimed to have buried a 2004 American League Championship Series program/scorecard, but has not said where he placed it.[36] These attempts did not have much effect upon the home team, though: the Yankees went on to win the 2009 World Series at the end of their first MLB season in the new stadium.[37]\n",
      "The new stadium is meant to evoke elements of the original Yankee Stadium, both in its original 1923 state and its post-renovation state in 1976. The exterior resembles the original look of the 1923 Yankee Stadium. The interior, a modern ballpark with greater space and increased amenities, features a playing field that closely mimics the 1988–2008 dimensions of the old stadium. The current stadium features 4,300 club seats and 68 luxury suites.\n",
      "The stadium was designed by the architectural firm Populous. The exterior was made from 11,000 pieces of Indiana limestone, along with granite and pre-cast concrete.[38] It features the building's name V-cut and gold-leaf lettered above each gate.[38] The interior of the stadium is adorned with hundreds of photographs capturing the history of the Yankees. The New York Daily News newspaper partnered with the Yankees for the exhibition \"The Glory of the Yankees Photo Collection\", which was selected from the Daily News' collection of over 2,000 photographs.[39] Sports & The Arts was hired by the Yankees to curate the nearly 1,300 photographs that adorn the building from sources including the Daily News, Getty Images, the Baseball Hall of Fame and Major League Baseball.\n",
      "The seats are laid out similar to the original Yankee Stadium's stands, with grandstand seating that stretches beyond the foul poles, as well as bleacher seats beyond the outfield fences. The Field Level and Main Level comprise the lower bowl, with suites on the H&R Block Level, and the Upper Level and Grandstand Level comprising the upper bowl.[40] Approximately 2⁄3 of the stadium's seating is in the lower bowl, the inverse from the original Yankee Stadium.[40] 50,287 fans can be seated, with a standing room capacity of 52,325.[41] The new stadium's seating is spaced outward in a bowl, unlike the stacked-tiers design at the old stadium. This design places most fans farther back but lower to the field, by about an average of 30 feet (9.1 m). Over 56 suites are located within the ballpark, triple the amount from the previous stadium.[38] Seats are 19–24 inches (48–61 cm) wide, up from the previous stadium's 18–22-inch (46–56 cm) wide seats, while there is 33–39 inches (84–99 cm) of leg room, up from 29.5 inches (75 cm) of leg room in the previous stadium.[40] Many lower-level seats are cushioned, while all seats are equipped with cupholders.[40] To allow for the extra seating space, the stadium's capacity is reduced by more than 4,000 seats in comparison to the previous stadium.[40]\n",
      "Many design elements of the ballpark's interior are inspired by the original Yankee Stadium. The roof of the new facility features a replica of the frieze that was a trademark of the previous ballpark.[40] In the original Yankee Stadium, a copper frieze originally lined the roof of the upper deck stands, but it was torn down during the 1974–75 renovations and replicated atop the wall beyond the bleachers.[40] The new stadium replicates the frieze in its original location along the upper deck stands.[40] Made of steel coated with zinc for rust protection, it is part of the support system for the cantilevers holding up the top deck and the lighting on the roof.[42] The wall beyond the bleacher seats is \"cut out\" to reveal the 4 subway trains as they pass by, like they were in the original facility. A manually operated auxiliary scoreboard was built into the left and right field fences, in the same locations it existed in the pre-renovation iteration of the original Yankee Stadium. They were removed in favor of advertising signage prior to the 2022 season.[40]\n",
      "Between the exterior perimeter wall and interior of the stadium is the \"Great Hall\", a large concourse that runs between Gates 4 and 6.[43] With seven-story ceilings, the Great Hall features more than 31,000 square feet (2,900 m2) of retail space and is lined with 20 banners of past and present Yankees superstars.[43] The Great Hall features a 5-by-383-foot (1.5 by 116.7 m) LED (light-emitting diode) ribbon display as well as a 25' by 36' LED video display above the entrance to the ballpark from Daktronics, a company in Brookings, South Dakota.[43][44]\n",
      "Monument Park, which features the Yankees' retired numbers, as well as monuments and plaques dedicated to distinguished Yankees, has been moved from its location beyond the left field fences in the original Yankee Stadium to its new location beyond the center field fences at the new facility. Monument Park is now situated under the sports bar; black shades cover the monuments on the back wall during games to prevent interference with the vision of the batter.[45] The new location of the monuments is meant to mirror their original placement in center field at the original pre-renovation Yankee Stadium, albeit when they were on the playing field. The transfer of Monument Park from the old stadium to the new stadium began on November 10, 2008.[46] The first monuments were put in place on February 23, 2009.[47] Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera requested that the Yankees reposition the team's bullpen, as well as add a door to connect the Yankees' bullpen to Monument Park, in order to allow access to it by Yankee relievers. The organization complied with his request.[38][48]\n",
      "The field dimensions for the large outfield fences have the same distance markers as the original facility prior to closing yet the dimensions are not identical.[49] Due to the design of the right-field stands and the inclusion of an embedded manual scoreboard, the right-field wall is an average of 5 feet (1.5 m) closer to home plate.[50] Overall, the fences measure 318 feet (97 m) to left field, 399 feet (122 m) to left-center field, 408 feet (124 m) to center field, 385 feet (117 m) to right-center field, and 314 feet (96 m) to right field.[40][41] At the old Yankee Stadium, the right field wall curved from the right-field corner to straightaway center, while at the new ballpark the fence takes a sharp, almost entirely straight angle.[50] This results in a difference at certain points between the right field markers of as much as 9 feet (2.7 m).[50] The dimensions in left field are substantially the same despite the presence of an embedded auxiliary scoreboard there as well.[50] All these differences make the current Yankee Stadium more batter-friendly than the original one.[51]\n",
      "The outfield fences measure 8 feet 5 inches (2.57 m) high from the left-field foul pole until the Yankees' bullpen, when the fences begin to gradually descend in height until the right field foul pole, where they are 8 feet (2.4 m) tall.[40] This also marks a decrease from the previous Yankee Stadium, where the outfield walls stood at a height of approximately 10 feet (3.0 m).[49] The distance from home plate to the backstop is 52 feet 4 inches (15.95 m), a reduction of 20 feet (6.1 m) from the previous facility.[41] The field is made up of Kentucky bluegrass, the same surface as the previous stadium, which is grown on a 1,300-acre (530 ha) farm in Bridgeton, New Jersey. The grass is equipped with a drainage system (featuring over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) of pipe) that makes the field playable an hour after taking 2 inches (51 mm) of rain.[40]\n",
      "Yankee Stadium features a wide array of amenities. It contains 63% more space, 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2) more in total, than the previous stadium, with wider concourses and open sight lines on concourses.[38] Along with 227 miles (365 km) of wired Ethernet cable, the building has sufficient fiber-optic cable wiring that Cisco Vice President and Treasurer David Holland calls the building \"future proof\".[38] Over 1,100 HD video monitors are placed within the stadium and approximately $10 million worth of baseball merchandise is housed within the ballpark.[38]\n",
      "The center field scoreboard, manufactured by Mitsubishi Diamond Vision, measures 59 x 101 feet (31 m) and offers 5,925 square feet (550.5 m2) of viewing area. It was the third-largest HD scoreboard in the world when it opened (behind the 8,736-square-foot (811.6 m2) board at newly renovated Kauffman Stadium and the new 8,066-square-foot (749.4 m2) board at the renovated Tokyo Racecourse).[52] Since then, it has also been surpassed by what was the world's largest scoreboard at AT&T Stadium and the new scoreboard at the Philadelphia Phillies' Citizens Bank Park.[53][54] Displaying 5,925 sq ft (550.5 m2) of video, the scoreboard can display four 1080p HD images simultaneously.[40]\n",
      "The Yankees clubhouse features 30,000 square feet (2,880 m2) of space, over 2.5 times the space of the clubhouse from the previous facility.[55] The dressing area alone features 3,344 sq ft (310.7 m2) of space, with each locker equipped with a safety deposit box and touch-screen computer.[55] The Yankees clubhouse features a weight room, training room, video room, and lounge area, while both teams' clubhouses have their own indoor batting cages.[55] The Yankees' therapy room features a hydrotherapy pool with an underwater treadmill.[55] The Yankees are believed to be the first team to chemically treat their uniforms, as well as the showering surfaces with an anti-bacterial agent that reduces the risk of infection.[55]\n",
      "The New York Yankees Museum, located on the lower level at Gate 6, displays a wide range of Yankees' memorabilia.[56] A \"Ball Wall\" features hundreds of balls autographed by past and present Yankees, and there are plans to eventually add autographs for every living player who has played for the Yankees.[56] The centerpiece of the museum is a tribute to Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, with a commemorative home plate in the floor and statues of Larsen pitching to Yogi Berra.[56] Along with a facsimile of a current locker from the Yankees' clubhouse, fans can view the locker of the late Thurman Munson, which sat unoccupied in the previous stadium's Yankee clubhouse in honor of Munson.[56]\n",
      "The ballpark offers a wide choice of restaurants. There are 25 fixed concessions stands, along with 112 movable ones.[43] A Hard Rock Cafe is located within the ballpark, but it is open to anyone at the 161st St. and River Ave. entrance year round.[43] The Hard Rock Cafe at Yankee Stadium officially opened on March 30, 2009, and an opening ceremony took place on April 2, 2009.[57] A steakhouse called NYY Steak is located beyond right field.[43] Celebrity chefs will occasionally make appearances at the ballpark's restaurants and help prepare food for fans in premium seating over the course of the season.[43] Above Monument Park is the Center Field Sports Bar, whose tinted black glass acts as the ballpark's batter's eye. After the 2016 season, the Yankees began doing updates to Yankee Stadium including the Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck and Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace. The Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck above the Center Field Sports Bar is an outdoor gathering space in center field with clear full views of the playing field available to all ticketed guests. The Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace overlook the visitors' and Yankees' bullpens respectively. The new AT&T Sports Lounge is behind section 134 on the main level and features a full bar, tables, stools and large screen TVs. The new Budweiser Party Decks located at sections 311 and 328 in the upper deck feature shaded standalone bar areas serving beer, cocktails and food. There is a new SunRun Kids Clubhouse located on the 300 level in right field and outfitted with Yankees-themed playground equipment. Ahead of the 2020 season, the Yankees added two new \"social spaces\"; the Stella Artois Landing at sections 232A and 232B in left field and the Michelob Ultra Clubhouse at sections 207 and 208 in right field. Both sections are available to fans with tickets anywhere in the Stadium.[58]\n",
      "Although Yankee Stadium has been praised for its amenities, it also has been widely criticized for high ticket prices.[59][60] Seats within the first eight rows in the lower bowl, called the \"Legends Suite\", are among the highest-priced tickets in professional sports. Tickets cost $510 on average; the most expensive tickets cost $2,600 each.[59] Legends Suite Seats have been regularly empty, with many ticket holders in this section having given up their tickets, and others remaining unsold, despite most other seats in the ballpark selling out. This has created an embarrassing image on television of the seats behind home plate being almost completely vacant.[59] Consequently, a surplus of tickets for Legends Seats have emerged in the secondary market, and with supply exceeding demand, resale prices have dropped. Empty seats in the Legends Suite could even be seen during the 2009 playoffs, including World Series games. Even though all playoff games were sellouts, Legends Suite ticket holders were in the lounges and the restaurant underneath instead of their seats.[61][62] Overall, the average ticket price is $63, the highest in baseball.[63]\n",
      "Legends Suite seats are also separate from the other lower bowl seating and are vigorously patrolled by stadium security, with the divider being described as a \"concrete moat.\"[59][60] Fans who do not have tickets within this premium section in the front rows are not allowed in the section. This includes standing behind the dugouts during batting practice and to seek autographs.[59][60] The least expensive seats, the bleachers, initially left many fans disappointed, as the indoor club seating area in center field obstructed the views from bleacher seats on both sides in sections 201 and 239. These severely obstructed sections would ultimately be removed during the 2016–2017 off-season in favor of outdoor bars and patio called Franks Red Hot Terrace in left center and Toyota Terrace in right center. These new areas are complete with standing terraces accessible to all ticket holders, in addition to replacing the seating on top of the center field club with standing terraces, drastically reducing the number of obstructed views from center field in the process.[64]\n",
      "The Yankee Stadium staff was also criticized for an incident during a May 4, 2009 game, which was interrupted by a rain delay.[65] Fans were told by some staff members that the game was unlikely to resume and consequently, many fans exited the stadium, only for the game to eventually resume play.[65] The fans that left the ballpark were not permitted to re-enter, per the stadium's re-entry policy, and many subsequently got into arguments with stadium personnel.[65] In response to the backlash the Yankees received for the incident, the staff members were required to sign a gag order preventing them from speaking to media, but they did indicate that communication for rain delays would be improved.[65]\n",
      "Late in the stadium's first season, cracks were seen on the concrete ramps of the Stadium. The Yankees are trying to determine whether there was something wrong with the concrete, or the ramps' installation or design. The company involved in inspecting the concrete was indicted on charges that its employees either faked or failed to perform some required tests and falsified the results of others.[66]\n",
      "The stadium has also been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball telecast in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in the old and new stadiums saying that \"As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait to get back in the dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout.\" Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent.[67] The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. \"This is a very easy place to play now,\" said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. \"Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here.\"[68] In his autobiography The Closer, the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote about the new stadium's atmosphere: \"It doesn't hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that.\"[69] Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, in which he said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: \"It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn't get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you.\"[70]\n",
      "\n",
      "In its first season, Yankee Stadium quickly acquired a reputation as a \"bandbox\" and a \"launching pad\" because of the high number of home runs hit at the new ballpark.[71][72][73][74][75][76]  Through its first 23 games, 87 home runs were hit at the venue, easily besting Enron Field's (now called Minute Maid Park) previous record set in 2000.[77]  Early in the season, Yankee Stadium was on pace to break Coors Field's 1999 single-season record of 303 home runs allowed, and the hometown Daily News (using the back-page headline \"HOMERS ODYSSEY\") started publishing a daily graphic comparing each stadium's home run totals through a similar number of games.\n",
      "ESPN commentator Peter Gammons denounced the new facility as \"one of the biggest jokes in baseball\" during an appearance on Mike and Mike in the Morning, and concluded that \"[it] was not a very well-planned ballpark\".[73]  Likewise, Gammons' ESPN colleague Buster Olney described the stadium as \"a veritable wind tunnel\"[71] and likened it to his childhood Wiffle-ball park.[78] Newsday columnist Wallace Matthews joined in the criticism, labeling the stadium \"ridiculous\" and accused \"the franchise that took ownership of the home run\" of cheapening it.  He suggested that Babe Ruth could have potentially hit 120 or more homers if he played in the new Stadium.  For his column, Matthews interviewed former Yankee Reggie Jackson, who termed the park \"too small\" to contain current player Alex Rodriguez.  Jackson estimated that the park might enable the third baseman to hit 75 home runs in a season.[72]\n",
      "A variety of theories have been posited to account for the dramatic increase in home runs at the new Yankee Stadium over the original stadium, foremost among these the sharper angles of the outfield walls[50] and the speculated presence of a wind tunnel.[71]  During construction of the new ballpark, engineers commissioned a wind study, the results of which indicated there would be no noticeable difference between the two stadiums.[79]  The franchise planned a second study, but Major League rules prohibit a team from making any changes to the playing field until the off-season.[79]\n",
      "An independent study by the weather service provider AccuWeather in June 2009 concluded that the shape and height of the right field wall, rather than the wind, is responsible for the proliferation of home runs at the stadium.[80]  AccuWeather's analysis found that roughly 20% of the home runs hit at the new ballpark would not have been home runs at the old ballpark due to the gentle curve of its right field corner, and its 10-foot (3.0 m) wall height.[80]  Nothing was observed in wind speeds and patterns that would account for the increase.[80]\n",
      "The number of home runs hit at the new stadium slowed significantly as the season progressed,[81] but a new single-season record for most home runs hit at a Yankee home ballpark was nonetheless set in the Yankees' 73rd home game of 2009 when Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim hit the 216th home run of the season at the venue, surpassing the previous record of 215 set at the original Yankee Stadium in 2005.[82] However, the Yankees offense, as in previous years, had employed many home run hitters in 2009. The Yankees hit 108 home runs while playing on the road, the second most in baseball behind the Philadelphia Phillies.[83]\n",
      "In 2010, the early rate of home runs were markedly less through May 15, 2010, with 35 home runs hit in 14 games for 2.5 per game (a projection of 205—in 2009, the stadium finished at 2.93 per game for a total of 237). Even though the stadium's home run rate decreased slightly for the 2010 season to 2.73 per game, it was still the highest figure in the majors.[84] However, the prolific home run rate of April and May 2009 that drew criticism has not sustained itself over any season thus far, and while through the first two months of the 2011 season the Yankees hit far more homers than any other team in the majors,[85] Yankee Stadium was not the top home run park.[84]\n",
      "Before the official Opening Day against the Cleveland Indians on April 16, 2009, the Yankees hosted a two-game exhibition series at the stadium in early April against the Chicago Cubs.[86] The Yankees lost the stadium's first regular-season game to the Indians and 2008 Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee by a score of 10–2. Before the Yankees went to bat for the first time, the bat that Babe Ruth used to hit his first home run at the old Yankee Stadium in 1923 was placed momentarily on home plate.[87] In the bottom of the fifth inning of the same game, Jorge Posada hit the first Yankee home run in the new ballpark off of Lee, which also served as New York's first run at the new venue. Later in that game, Grady Sizemore of the Indians hit the first grand slam at the stadium, doing so off of Yankee relief pitcher Dámaso Marte in the top of the seventh inning. On July 2, 2009, Russell Branyan of the Seattle Mariners became the first player to hit a home run off of the Mohegan Sun Restaurant in center field.\n",
      "Like its predecessor, the new Yankee Stadium hosted the World Series in its very first season; in the 2009 World Series, the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 2. It also became the latest stadium to host a World Series-clinching victory by its home team in the venue's first season (after the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series at Busch Stadium in 2006), when, on November 4, 2009, the Yankees won their 27th World Series championship against the Phillies. The Yankees are the only team to inaugurate two stadiums with World Series wins and also appeared in the 1976 World Series following the refurbishment of the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the Big Red Machine in a four-game sweep. On October 6, 2011 Detroit Tigers in game five of the ALDS were the first team to eliminate the Yankees at the new Yankee Stadium in the postseason.\n",

In 2009, Derek Jeter became the Yankees all-time hits leader with his 2,722nd hit, surpassing Lou Gehrig's 72-year record.[88]  The following season, Alex Rodriguez hit his 600th home run at the Stadium, becoming the youngest player to accomplish the feat.[89]  In 2011, three significant milestones were achieved at the stadium.  In July, Jeter became the first Yankee to join the 3,000 hit club and collect all 3,000 hits with the franchise.[90]  The following month, the Yankees became the first team in history to hit three grand slams in a single game.[91] As the regular season drew to a close, Mariano Rivera became the all-time leader in regular season saves, when he earned his 602nd save.[92]\n",

Aside from existing parking lots and garages serving the stadium, construction for additional parking garages is planned. The New York State Legislature agreed to $70 million in subsidies for a $320 million parking garage project. On October 9, 2007, the New York City Industrial Development Agency approved $225 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of three new parking garages that will have 3,600 new parking spaces, and renovation of the existing 5,569 parking spaces nearby.[97] Plans initially called for a fourth new garage, but this was eliminated before the final approval. The garages will be built (and renovated) by the Community Initiatives Development Corporation of Hudson, a nonprofit entity that will use the parking revenue to repay the bonds and pay a $3 million yearly land lease to the City of New York. Parking is expected to cost $25 per game.[97] To enhance security and expedite entry, Yankee Stadium implemented a clear bag policy, allowing only transparent bags of specific dimensions for easier inspection and quicker access.[98][99]\n",

      "Effective 2016, printed electronic tickets cannot be used at New York Yankees and New York City FC matches at Yankee Stadium. Only traditional hard-stock tickets, and those issued via a mobile ticketing system, are accepted. The team justified the decision by stating that it was meant to combat fraud associated with printed digital tickets. However, it was also believed that the team was trying to specifically hinder the ticket resale service StubHub, which competed against an official resale service run by TicketMaster known as the Yankees Ticket Exchange. The YTE is subject to a price flooring policy, meaning that tickets may only be discounted up to a certain amount. Although StubHub was the official ticket resale partner of Major League Baseball at the time, the Yankees, as well as the Los Angeles Angels and Chicago Cubs, had opted out of this agreement.[121]\n",
      "Owing to the Yankees' ownership of the team, New York City FC announced on March 11, 2016, that its matches would also be subject to this policy. At the team's March 13, 2016 home opener, although the team stated that they would be phasing in mobile ticketing by introducing additional verification steps for printed tickets before the policy takes full effect in April, reports indicated that the stadium was turning away fans with printed tickets, leading to long queue lines, as well as few attendees inside the stadium itself.[122][123] In an interview with WFAN radio, Yankees COO Lonn Trost explained that the measures were to help combat ticket resale, arguing that the team did not want fans to purchase \"premium\" seats at bargain prices, because they would be filled by \"someone who has never sat in a premium location [before]\".[124]\n",
      "On April 3, 2016, an episode of the HBO news-comedy series Last Week Tonight aired, where host John Oliver responded to Trost's remarks, arguing that he was \"saying that rich people couldn't bear to sit next to people who aren't as rich.\" As a further satire of Trost's arguments against discounted resale, Oliver then announced a contest in which viewers were invited to send photos of themselves dressed as if they had \"never sat in a premium location before\", with winners offered the ability to purchase a pair of Legends Seats from one of the first three home games of the season for 25 cents. The stunt was successful, leading to the presence of several costumed attendees in Legends Seats during the opening games.

The service will still be subject to a price flooring policy, but the team stated that the new arrangement would provide a \"superior, more secure, [and] better experience\".[128][129]\n",

      "The Bronx Zoo (also historically the Bronx Zoological Park and the Bronx Zoological Gardens) is a zoo within Bronx Park in the Bronx, New York. It is one of the largest zoos in the United States by area and is the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States by area,[5] comprising 265 acres (107 ha) of park lands and naturalistic habitats separated by the Bronx River. On average, the zoo has 2.15 million visitors each year as of 2009[update].[5] The zoo's original permanent buildings, known as Astor Court, were designed as a series of Beaux-Arts pavilions grouped around the large circular sea lion pool.[6] The Rainey Memorial Gates were designed by sculptor Paul Manship in 1934 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[7]\n",
      "The zoo opened on November 8, 1899, featuring 843 animals in 22 exhibits. Its first director was William Temple Hornaday, who served as director for 30 years. From its inception the zoo has played a vital role in animal conservation. In 1905, the American Bison Society was created in an attempt to save the American bison, which had been depleted from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred, from extinction. Two years later they were successfully reintroduced into the wild. In 2007, the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild. The breeding was a milestone in the zoo's 10-year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China.\n",
      "Today, the Bronx Zoo is world-renowned for its large and diverse animal collection, and its award-winning exhibitions.[5] The zoo is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and it is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).[8]\n",

      "On December 17, 1902, the zoo became one of the seven zoos outside of Australia, and one of only two in the United States, to ever hold the now-extinct thylacine. The first was a male obtained from German animal dealer Carl Hagenbeck. It died on August 15, 1908. The zoo received a second male on January 26, 1912, from the Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania, who later died on November 20 of that year. The zoo received its final two animals from Sydney animal dealer Ellis S. Joseph. The first was an unsexed individual who arrived on November 7, 1916, in poor condition and died seven days later. The second and final animal was a female purchased from the Beaumaris Zoo by Joseph for £25[clarification needed] (~$35) and then was resold to the zoo, arriving on July 14, 1917.[18] On a visit, the director of the Melbourne Zoo, Mr. Le Souef, said upon seeing the animal:\n",

      "In early 1903, the zoo was gifted a pair of Barbary lions, a subspecies which is extinct in the wild. The female was named Bedouin Maid and male Sultan, who went on to become one of the zoo's most popular animals. Displayed in the Lion House, Sultan was four years old at the time and described as being both \"a perfect specimen\" and \"unusually good tempered\". In May 1903, the pair produced three cubs, the first to be born at the zoo. On October 7, 1905, Charles R. Knight painted a portrait of Sultan and the animal went on to be the focus of many of the zoo's postcards. Sultan was also the model for the lion which sits atop the Rainey Memorial Gates.[19]\n",

      "On June 6, 1990, the zoo received a female Sumatran rhinoceros named Rapunzel. At the time, the zoo was one of only three in North America to hold the critically endangered species, with the Cincinnati and San Diego Zoos being the others, holding one female each. The three institutions were a part of the Sumatran Rhino Trust's plan to start a captive breeding program for the species.[26] Rapunzel was born in the wild in Sumatra and rescued from an area of rainforest that was slated to be cleared for a palm oil plantation in 1989. Though it's believed she bred in the wild, she never produced any calves in captivity. It was eventually determined that she was past reproductive age, at which point she was returned to the zoo in 2000, having been brought out for breeding purposes. She lived in the Zoo Center until her death in December 2005 in her 30s.[27]\n",

      "In 2009, New York City[who?] cut funding for the state's 76 zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens. The Wildlife Conservation Society as a whole suffered a $15-million deficit, and the zoo was forced to downsize its staff and animal collection. The budget cuts forced the buyouts of over 100 employees and layoffs of dozens more as well as the closure of four sections of the zoo: World of Darkness, Rare Animal Range, the Skyfari, and a small section of the overall still-open African Plains exhibit which featured endangered antelope.[31][32] In the end, 186 staff positions (15%) were cut within the WCS. In 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg passed another budget cut that took $4.7-million from the funding of the zoo and the New York Aquarium, also run by the WCS. This cut represented more than half of what the collections were receiving. However, Bloomberg also passed an energy subsidy that brought the cuts down to $3.7-million.[33]\n",
      "In the summer of 2014, New York Representative Carolyn B. Maloney visited the Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan, China and announced her plan to bring giant pandas to New York City. Initially, she aimed to exhibit them at the Central Park Zoo, though switched her attention to the Bronx after deciding the 6.5-acre zoo didn't have the resources to care for the animals. Maloney and her supporters, which included Maurice R. Greenberg, Newt Gingrich, and John A. Catsimatidis, were met with many obstacles throughout their campaign. Initially, the largest issues were the lack of support from Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Hall, and Chinese officials insisting that no more pandas be brought to the United States. However, in October 2015, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai announced that his country was willing to enter preliminary talks with the city over the matter, and soon after de Blasio and City Hall signed a letter appealing to Chinese officials, drafted by Maloney in 2014. Despite her efforts, Maloney's campaign still has yet to overcome two critical steps in acquiring pandas: funding and the zoo's consent. Both de Blasio and the Wildlife Conservation Society refuse to fund the project, not wanting taxpayer or vital zoo money to go towards the highly expensive project. David Towne, chairman of the American-based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, estimated that the cost of bringing pandas to the city would be around $50 million.\n",
      "The foundation has also said that the cost of keeping just one such animal is about $1 million a year, including food, trainers, and habitat upkeep. Additionally, China loans out their pandas for a hefty fee. A study published by The Washington Post in 2005 found that the four U.S. zoos holding pandas—the Memphis Zoo, the San Diego Zoo, the National Zoological Park (located in Washington, D.C., and Front Royal, Virginia) and Zoo Atlanta—had spent $33 million more on their animals than revenue made off of them between 2000 and 2003. Despite the figures, Maloney believes pandas in her city will do better since the city has a higher population than those four cities combined, and received a record-breaking 56.4-million visitors in 2014. Still, the WCS continues to steer away from bringing in these pandas. In 2014, a senior official from the WCS said Maloney's campaign had reached \"a new level of absurdity\" when it was announced she intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo. In November 2015, Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director, released a statement saying:[34][35]\n",
      "The concept of bringing Giant Pandas to New York which the Congresswoman is proposing is complex and would require that a number of complicated issues be considered and resolved before any such plan could be implemented.\n",
      "Any decision to bring giant pandas to New York would need to be based on positively contributing to the conservation of giant pandas in the wild and a determination that all the requirements necessary to keep the animals well in New York could be met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very importantly, there is no funding for this initiative. Building and maintenance of such a exhibit would be an ongoing effort that would require tens of millions of dollars up front and annual support monies for pandas for however long they would be in the city. Any agreement to exhibit pandas would have to come with a guarantee of provision for the necessary funds.The zoo has two types of displays: free exhibits accessible with a General Admission ticket, and premium exhibits which require additional fees.[36][37]\n",

The exhibit originally opened in 1941 and was the first in the country to allow visitors to view predators and their prey in a naturalistic setting as well as allowing large predators such as lions to be exhibited cage-free.[5] This success was achieved through the creation of a series of deep moats, a set-up which can still be found at the zoo today.[15] The wild dogs, however, can be viewed close-up from a glass-fronted viewing pavilion.[42] The zoo has bred their lions on multiple occasions, including one male and two females born in January 2010 and three males and one female born in August 2013. The zoo, in partnership with the New York Daily News, held a contest to name the 2010 cubs, which made their public debut in April 2010. The winning names were Shani, Nala, and Adamma.[43] The 2013 cubs were named Thulani, Ime, Bahata, and Amara[44] and the three males can still be found on-exhibit at the zoo.\n",

      "Big Bears features four bears, a male grizzly bear and three ABC Islands bears rescued as orphans from Baranof Island of Alaska.[49]\n",
      "Until 2015, two female grizzly bears named Betty and Veronica also lived in this exhibit, but moved to the Central Park Zoo where they died in 2020 and 2021.[50]\n",
      "The zoo also formerly housed polar bears until the last individual, a 26-year-old male named Tundra died in December 2017.[51] Three dholes from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park were added to the habitat in 2019.[52]\n",
      "Gelada Reserve, originally called Baboon Reserve, opened in 1990. It is a two-acre recreation of the Ethiopian highlands which, at the time of its opening, was the largest primate exhibit in the United States.[53] The exhibit's main features revolve around the zoo's troop of geladas such as artificial rocks and earthbanks, and displays about life in the highlands and the side-by-side evolution of humans and geladas. Visitors can watch the geladas from multiple viewpoints along with Nubian ibex and rock hyrax, all of which are mixed together in the hilly enclosure. An African village-styled café overlooks the exhibit. Baboon Reserve won the AZA Exhibit Award in 1991.[53][54] In the fall of 2014, a male gelada was born at the zoo, the first in over 13 years, and was the only zoo in the US to display them until the San Diego Zoo in 2017 received their gelada troop for their Africa Rocks exhibit. [55][56]\n",
      "Himalayan Highlands, which opened on June 27, 1986,[57] recreates the Himalayas region of Asia. The exhibit is known for its highly naturalistic look and use of the hilly and rocky terrain found in that portion of the zoo. The stars of the exhibit are the zoo's multiple snow leopards. The exhibit also is home to red pandas and white-naped cranes. In 2006, the zoo brought in a male snow leopard named Leo from Pakistan after he was orphaned at around two months old.[58] Leo sired a male cub on April 9, 2013. The cub is one of more than 70 snow leopards born at the zoo, which was the first U.S. zoo to exhibit the species in 1903. Leo later became a grandfather when his son sired a female cub in 2017.[59]\n",
      "Madagascar!, which opened on June 20, 2008, recreates various habitats found on the island of Madagascar and contains a variety of wildlife from the island, including lemurs, lesser hedgehog tenrecs, fossas, Nile crocodiles, radiated tortoises, greater vasa parrots and highly endangered cichlids.[39][60] Ring-tailed lemurs, collared lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, crowned lemurs, and Coquerel's sifakas are the lemur species held in the exhibit. Madagascar! holds the first two ring-tailed mongoose in the United States and is home to over 100,000 Madagascar hissing cockroaches that can be named for $10 around Valentine's Day.[5][61] The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on the many threats to the survival of these species as well as the WCS's conservation work in Madagascar. The building was converted from the former Lion House, which had opened in 1903 and closed by the late 1980s. The exhibit also has tomato frogs.\n",
      "The Mouse House is a small building home to various species of small mammals, particularly rodents. The building features both diurnal and nocturnal areas and a row of outdoor cages which, during the summer months, are home to a variety of small primates, many of which are former monkey house inhabitants. Species include short-eared elephant shrews, eastern spiny mice, western spotted skunks, fennec foxes, Senegal bushbabies, Damaraland mole-rats and long-tailed chinchillas.\n",
      "The current Aquatic Bird House opened on September 24, 1964, on the foundation of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, with the rest of the zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them.[62] Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, anhingas, boat-billed herons and Madagascar crested ibises are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and a large aviary home to greater and lesser adjutants.\n",
      "The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015.[63] The Aquatic Bird House is also home to another endangered stork species: the Storm's stork. The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building,[64] and in May 2015, a colony of Australian little penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.[65]\n",
      "The Russell B. Aitken Sea Bird Aviary, which opened on May 17, 1997, is a huge walk-through aviary designed to resemble the Patagonian coast. The aviary stands at 60-feet high, occupies 615,000 cubic feet, is supported by five steel arches, and netted with a stainless steel mesh. The aviary was built to replace the original De Jur Aviary that opened with the zoo in 1899 and collapsed in a snowstorm in February 1995.[66] The exhibit's height and open space allows the residents to soar around above visitor's heads and the fake sea cliff walls allows for more natural nesting and roosting behavior. The aviary is home to about 100 birds, most being Inca terns, but also a small colony of Magellanic penguins, grey gulls, and brown pelicans. The aviary was also home to the last guanay cormorant in captivity outside of South America. In April 2014, four Peruvian pelicans were added to the exhibit,[67] and in January 2015, a pair of ruddy-headed geese were added.[68]\n",
      "Tiger Mountain, which opened on May 15, 2003, is a three-acre exhibit which features Amur tigers and occasionally Malayan tigers, who are usually kept off-exhibit. The exhibit has two enclosures with glass viewing, the second of which has a 10,000 gallon pool with underwater viewing. Outside of the tigers, the exhibit has multiple interactive displays designed to educate visitors on behavioral enrichment and on the zoo's/WCS' ex-situ and in-situ conservation.\n",
      "The exhibit won the AZA Exhibit Award in 2004.[69] The zoo has had good breeding successful with both subspecies of tiger, having bred both in 2010.[70] Another set of Siberian tiger cubs were born in 2012,[71] and a pair of Malayan tiger cubs were born in 2016.[72] One of the tiger cubs named Nadia tested positive for COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, but have since recovered from the disease.[73] Across from the entrance to Tiger Mountain, a large herd of Père David's deer and a pair of whooper swans can be found.\n",
      "World of Birds, which originally opened in 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades in the summer of 2010,[74] and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos,[75] a pair of knobbed hornbills, Andean cock-of-the-rocks, Nicobar pigeons, southern bald ibises, ocellated turkeys, Cuban amazons, and white-throated bee-eaters. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so.[76] In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works toward preserving this species in the wild as well.[75]\n",
      "World of Reptiles has been an attraction at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo.[77] The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, as well as a window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of species, including American alligators, blue iguanas, Cuban crocodiles, dyeing poison dart frogs, eyelash vipers, Fly River turtles, giant musk turtles, green anacondas, hellbenders, Milos viper, king cobras and Philippine sailfin lizards. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction.[78] On March 25, 2011, an Egyptian cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra MIA (Missing In Action) and placed it on exhibit.[79]\n",
      "The Pheasant Aviary is a long row of cages home to a large variety of bird species, particularly pheasants. Exhibited species include Elliot's pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant, Cabot's tragopan, blue eared-pheasant, mountain peacock-pheasant, Mérida helmeted curassow, Swinhoe's pheasant, Java peafowl, eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby's parakeet, Montezuma oropendola and yellow-crested cockatoo.\n",
      "Birds of Prey is a row of cages for multiple raptor species. The exhibit is home to bald eagles,  burrowing owls, snowy owls, an Andean condor, cinereous vultures and king vultures. In February 2011, the zoo received two bald eagles rescued in Wyoming.[80] Nearby is a small pond for black-necked swans, American white pelicans and brown pelicans.\n",
      "The Zoo Center, built in 1908, is a one-story Beaux-Arts building located in Astor Court. The exhibit houses blue tree monitors, Mertens' water monitors and spiny-tailed monitors indoors and has both indoor and outdoor enclosures for Komodo dragons, Aldabra giant tortoises and southern white rhinoceros.[81] The building's animal frieze was carved by A. P. Proctor.[5] In 2000, the building was landmarked.[82] The building is east of the Children's Zoo and south of Madagascar!.[83]\n",
      "The building was originally designed as the zoo's Elephant House and has held all three elephant species over its history.[84] The building has also been home to various rhinoceros species, hippopotamus, Bactrian camel, Malayan tapir and North Sulawesi babirusa. The building also held Rapunzel, one of the few Sumatran rhinos held in U.S. zoos, until her death in 2005.[85]\n",
      "The Bison Range is in the northeast corner of the zoo,[86] and has been a feature of the zoo since its opening, having been only renovated since 1971. The range initially served to breed Plains bison, who were in danger of becoming extinct in the United States. The exhibit is one of the few large herds of bison in U.S. zoos. In 1913, at the behest of the American Bison Society, fourteen bison were transported from the range to Montana's National Bison Range, as well as to Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota.[87]\n",
      "Northern Ponds is a series of naturalistic ponds home to a variety of waterfowl and other aquatic birds both wild and captive. Captive residents include black-necked cranes, red-breasted geese, lesser white-fronted geese, ruddy ducks, barnacle geese, mute swans and trumpeter swans. A wide variety of wild bird species can also be found in the ponds, including several native ducks such as mallards and mergansers, as well as other birds such as black-capped night-herons.\n",
      "The Mitsubishi Riverwalk is a path that curves around the Bronx River, on the opposite bank from the zoo. It opened in 2004 upon the completion of a cleanup project on the river. The walkway was funded by Mitsubishi International Corporation Foundation[88] and protects 15 acres (6.1 ha) of Bronx River watershed.[89]\n",
      "One admission to a premium exhibit costs between $12 and 14 per person per exhibit if paid separately. The fee for unlimited admission grants the ticket holder free access to all attractions for that day. Family memberships include full access.[90]\n",
      "There are nine premium exhibit attractions:\n",
      "The Treetop Adventure Climb and Zipline requires a different fee and is not part of the admission fee online.[90] Thus, it is not included in the park ticket or in any membership.\n",
      "Budgie Landing is an exhibit featuring of 1,000 budgerigars which opened on May 27, 2023.[91] Unlike premium attractions and exhibits, Budgie Landing requires all visitors pay a small entrance fee ($5 for regular guests and $3 for members). A complementary feeding stick is handed out with admission.[92]\n",
      "The Bug Carousel has seats shaped like insects. Installed in 2005, it has an annual ridership of 540,000 as of 2014.[93]\n",
      "This permanent structure is an indoor butterfly conservatory which lets visitors walk through gardens and meadows and watch the butterflies up close.\n",
      "[94] Built and inaugurated in mid-1996, the attraction is a 170-foot-long maze, where \"visitors can walk through the stages of a monarch's metamorphosis\" with a greenhouse in the middle hosting 44 species and over 1,000 butterflies; the greenhouse is really \"a plastic tent on an aluminum frame\".\n",
      "The structure, costing $500,000, is the precursor for a future permanent House of Invertebrates in the Monkey House near the Fordham Road entrance. Many species come from the New York metropolitan area, and all species of butterflies and moths are from around the continent.\n",
      "If not successful, the Oklahoma City Zoo would have purchased it in September 1997.[95]\n",
      "The original Children's Zoo in the Bronx Zoo opened in 1941 with a nursery-rhyme theme; in 1981, a new Children's Zoo opened, and was instantly successful, seeing almost 250,000 visitors in two months. It closed for renovations in 2013;[96] it reopened on May 30, 2015, with new exhibits featuring giant anteaters, pudús, Linne's two-toed sloth, squirrel monkeys, Asian small-clawed otters, prairie dogs, fennec foxes, Nubian goats, zebus, alpacas, sheep, donkeys, chickens, ducks, pigs, geese and domestic turkeys.[97]\n",
      "In the southwestern part of the zoo, Congo Gorilla Forest is a 6.5-acre (2.6 ha) rainforest that is home to the 20 or so western lowland gorillas in the zoo. Angolan colobus, Wolf's guenons, pygmy marmosets and mandrills also call this area home. Visitors walk through the area and can also view it from treetop lookouts.[98]\n",
      "The Congo Gorilla Forest was opened in 1999 and was visited 7,000,000 times as of 2009[update].[99] In one of the largest breeding groups of western lowland gorillas in North America, the exhibit has two troops of gorillas, for a total of 19 gorillas. Since 1999, 14 gorillas, 23 red river hogs, 11 Wolf's guenons, and four okapis have been born in the exhibit.[99] There is also an 8-minute film in the middle of the exhibit, as well as viewing points throughout. In total, there are about 400 animals from 55 species. Over $10.6 million for conservation of Central African habitats has been collected in donations since the exhibit's opening,[100] and the exhibit has netted $12.5 million in exhibit fees as of 2014[update].[101][102]\n",

Visitors can watch the gibbons swinging or singing and watch the otters play. The exhibit includes species that are usually on the jungle floor including stag beetles, scorpions and fire-bellied toads, but behind glass. A pond with a waterfall lets visitors sit and observe gourami and Fly River turtles.[104]\n",
      "Planning for JungleWorld, in the southeastern Wild Asia portion of the zoo, was started in 1977 and completed at a cost of $9.5 million in June 1985. $4.1 million in funds were donated by Enid A. Haupt, a member of the New York Zoological Society's board of trustees.[105] The building is the largest at the zoo with an area of 1 acre (4,000 m2) and a height of 55 ft (17 m). There is a wooden path that meanders for 0.13 mi (210 m).\n",
      "The building's design integrates its environment with the path, as no bars are present in the building; the walkway has no full-height barriers and short railings; and only by means of ravines, streams, or cliffs are most of the animals separated from people and each other. There is a volcanic scrub forest, a mangrove swamp, a lowland evergreen rain forest with giant trees which merges into a mountain rain forest and five museum-like galleries connecting and explaining the habitats.[105] The building was built to emphasize the fact that 150 acres (61 ha) of rainforest is lost every minute.[106]\n",
      "The monorail was inaugurated in 1977 with the rest of the formerly underdeveloped Wild Asia section of the zoo. There are six 9-car monorails on this 1.6 mi (2.6 km) ride, originally built by Rohr; the ride was refurbished in 2007.[107] Some animals in the zoo can only be seen on this ride such as tigers, Przewalski's horses, Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephants, red pandas, and a plethora of even-toed ungulates such as axis deer, barasingha, blackbuck, gaurs, brow-antlered deer, babirusas, sambar deer, nilgai, red muntjacs, hog deer, Formosan sika deer, tufted deer, Himalayan tahrs and markhors.[3]\n",
      "This ride takes visitors through a 40-acre (16 ha) area that recreates the mud wallows and pastures, forests and riverbanks of Asia. Visitors will see tigers, Indian elephants, rhinos and wild horses in their natural habitats. As the monorail travels along the Bronx River, visitors can see native animals including egrets, turtles, and ducks. The monorail is accessible for wheelchairs up to 26 inches (66 cm) wide. Smaller chairs are available at the monorail platform for visitors with wider wheelchairs or motorized scooters.[108]\n",
      "Nature Trek opened on July 1, 2017, in the southeast portion of the park near Wild Asia. It consists of twelve covered rope bridges[109] connecting small porches on the sides of towers.[110][111][112] There are also elevated tunnels and a large overlook, as well as several small challenges resembling American Ninja Warrior obstacles.[109] On the ground is a play area with a sandbox, water sprinklers and structures, and branches.[113][109] Nature Trek is partially wheelchair-accessible[109] and contains ramps of varying difficulties.[110] This attraction discourages visitors who are wearing footwear such as flip-flops; high heels are prohibited.[113] As part of a push for environmental sustainability, some parts of the attraction are made of black locust, and the structures use existing trees within the forest.[110]\n",
      "The Treetop Adventure section opened on July 7, 2017, in the northeast portion of the park near Bronx River Parking. It consists of seven different levels of rope courses: two each of beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and one expert course.[109] There is also a 400 ft (120 m) zip-line course traversing 50 ft (15 m) the Bronx River in both directions.[111][112] The attraction also contains rope and swinging bridges, ladders and rolling and swinging objects. Separate from the rest of the zoo, it charges its own entry fee;[114][111] the fee is only applied to those who are climbing on the objects or using the zip-line.[114] Open year-round,[109] the attraction prohibits riders who are less than 7 years old and less than 50 lb (23 kg), or more than 275 lb (125 kg).[110][109]\n",
      "Dinosaur Safari takes visitors on a safari ride through a normally off-exhibit 2-acre wooded area and features animatronic dinosaurs from throughout time, starting at 300-million-years ago in the Permian Period and ending 235-million-years later in the Cretaceous Period. The ride lasts approximately 20 minutes. The \"robo-saurs\" are manufactured by Billings Productions, who lease them out to sites all over the world. The exhibit features more popular species such as the Triceratops and Brachiosaurus, as well as less well-known species such as the Pachycephalosaurus. The ride's Dilophosaurus spit water at visitors as a nod to the species' acid-spitting abilities in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park film and Michael Crichton's novel, even though there is no reason to believe the living animal did so.[115][116] The exhibit originally ran through the summers of 2013[115] and 2014[116] and returned for the 2019 season.[117]\n",
      "World of Darkness opened in 1969 and was the world's first major exhibit designed specifically to introduce the public to nocturnal animals such as the Chinese leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis), bay duiker, Pallas's long-tongued bat, spiny mouse, lesser mouse lemur, small spotted genet, lesser spear-nosed bats, spotted skunk, fat-tailed lemurs Jamaican fruit bat, Mohol bushbaby, cloud rat, Hoffman's two-toed sloth, rock cavy, pygmy slow loris, short-tailed bats, striped skunk, grey-legged night monkey, sand cat, Rodriguez flying fox, brush-tailed porcupine, broad-snouted caiman, sand boa and marine toad.[118] Built by Morris Ketchum Jr. & Associates, the house was built where the zoo's Rocking Stone Restaurant stood until 1942. The exhibit used red-lights to dimly illuminate the enclosures within the windowless building. Like all nocturnal exhibits, the house ran on a reversed lighting schedule, which simulated night and day at opposite times to allow visitors to view nocturnal animals in a more naturalistic setting.[119] Due to budget cuts and the high cost of running the exhibit, it was closed in 2009.[31][32]\n",
      "Rare Animal Range was a trail which focused on highly endangered species.[118] Featured species included guanaco, Formosan sika deer, pied ruffed lemurs and blue-eyed black lemurs.[120][121] The exhibit also had duplicate enclosures for the zoo's Arabian oryx, blesbok, Père David's deer and broad-snouted caiman as well as a large pond with a pair of small islands in the center which were home to a pair of golden-cheeked gibbons. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of many of the species, the zoo was forced to close the exhibit in 2009.[31][32]\n",
      "While most of the species left the zoo when the exhibit closed, the Formosan sika deer were moved to the Wild Asia Monorail and the Père David's deer remained in their primary enclosure across from Tiger Mountain while the blue-eyed black lemurs were moved to Madagascar! where they are rotated with the Coquerel's sifakas. While no longer at the zoo, pied ruffed lemurs can still be seen at the zoo's partner institute, the Central Park Zoo.[122] The zoo's popular Dinosaur Safari ran through a part of this area and the zoo's yearly Run for the Wild event runs through its entirety.\n",
      "The Skyfari was a popular gondola lift which transported visitors from the Zoo Center to the Asian Plaza, running over African Plains and several other popular exhibits at the zoo. The seasonal exhibit ran from April to October and rose 60 to 100 ft (18 to 30 m) feet in the air. With around 490,000 riders annually, the lift was the zoo's third most popular attraction after Congo Gorilla Forest and the Wild Asia Monorail. Despite its popularity, ticket sales for it were barely breaking-even and maintenance costs led to a loss of profit. On July 8, 2008, high winds and heat led to one of the cars derailing, which trapped thirty-six passengers for up to five hours.[123] Due to this, along with heavy budget cuts, the ride was permanently closed in January 2009, after 35 years of operation.[124]\n",
      "The Monkey House, which first opened in 1901 and was originally named the Primate House, closed in late February 2012 after 111 years of operation.[125][126] At the time of closing, it was home to cotton-top tamarins, white-faced sakis, Wied's marmosets, moustached tamarins, black-chinned emperor tamarins, Goeldi's monkeys and grey-handed night-monkeys, as well as Brazilian porcupines and Pallas's long-tongued bats. This was the building where Ota Benga spent most of his time during his stay at the zoo.[126]\n",
      "Some of the primates that were in the now-closed exhibit have been moved to other parts of the zoo, such as the cotton-top tamarins now being found in World of Birds; others were sent to other New York City zoos, such as the sakis being moved to the Central Park Zoo. White-headed capuchins can still be seen in an outdoor cage behind the building.[126]\n",
      "Amazing Amphibians was a short-lived exhibition which opened in the zoo's Zoo Center in June 2008 and only remained for a few years. The exhibit featured several educational displays on amphibian conservation as well as a few terrariums containing several amphibian species. Highlight species included Chacoan horned frog, Puerto Rican crested toad, smooth-sided toad and common mudpuppy.[127]\n",

      "The Most Dangerous Animal in the World exhibit debuted at the Bronx Zoo on April 26, 1963.[130] The exhibit was installed at the Great Apes House and it featured a statement about the danger humans pose.[131]\n",
      "The words: \"The Most Dangerous Animal in the World\" were printed in red on top of a cage.[132] Behind the bars of the cage there was a mirror. The exhibit was reportedly still at the zoo in 1981.[133]\n",
      "In April 2008, the zoo hosted the first Run for the Wild event. The event is a 5k run (5 km (3.1 mi) long) organized by the Wildlife Conservation Society with the goal of raising money and awareness for their conservation programs of endangered species. Each year, there is a set entry fee for participants with varying prices depending on age; child (3–15), adult, and senior (65+). WCS Members get a discounted fee. Along with the entry fee, there is a $35 minimum donation per adult/senior participant. The event offers free prizes for donors, based on donation size, ranging from a Run for the Wild T-shirt to a special animal experience at the zoo. All donations are tax-deductible. All participants are also offered free all-day entry to the zoo and its paid exhibits/attractions. The yearly event takes place at the end of April and originally began at 8 am for those wishing to actually run, and 8:45 for those who wish to simply walk or jog; the start times were changed to 7 am and 7:45 am in later years.[134]\n",
      "The event takes participants through the zoo before opening hours, starting at the Bronx River Parkway Entrance, through the Asian Plaza and African Plains, and ending by the Rockefeller Fountain near Astor Court. The trail also takes runners through the now-closed section of the zoo where the Rare Animal Range once stood. Each year, the event focuses on a specific endangered species or animal group to help raise funds for: 2009's run was for gorillas, 2010 focused on tigers, 2011 helped raise funds to protect the Punta Tombo peninsula of Argentina for Magellanic penguins, 2012 focused on lions, both 2013 and 2014 focused on elephants, 2015 once again was for gorillas, and 2016's run will allow participants to run on behalf of their favorite animal.[134][135]\n",
      "In 2011, another WCS institute, the New York Aquarium, held its own Run for the Wild event for sea turtles in early October. The 5k run began at the aquarium and led down the Riegelmann Boardwalk on Coney Island.[136] The aquarium held a second run the following year for walruses.[137] The event has not returned to the aquarium since.\n",
      "In 1905, the zoo's first director, William T. Hornaday, along with President Theodore Roosevelt and other conservationists, created the American Bison Society (ABS) in an attempt to save the American bison from extinction. The bison had been depleted from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred by the end of the 19th century due to westward expansion. The society worked to breed the species in captivity as well as raise public awareness, raise money to create protected reserves, and reintroduce bison back into the wild.[15] On October 11, 1907, the first reintroduction of bison began when the zoo sent six males and nine females, by rail, to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. Seven days later, the animals were successfully reintroduced to the park.[138] By 1935, the society, who had successfully carried out several more reintroductions from bison kept in zoos and ranches, considered their work done and disbanded that year.\n",
      "In 2005, the Wildlife Conservation Society resurrected and re-purposed the ABS to, \"help build the social and scientific foundations for the ecological restoration of bison\", and, \"restore bison ecologically, not just animals in pens but actual functioning animals in the larger landscape\", (Keith Aune, WCS bison coordinator).[139][140] According to a study published in 2012, virtually all wild and captive bison in the United States are hybrids with cattle genes, with the exception of the two distinct breeding populations within Yellowstone National Park and their descendants. The cattle genes entered the bison population due to private ranchers hybridizing their bison to make them more docile, with some of these animals being accidentally reintroduced by the ABS.[141] In response, in the fall of 2011, the WCS arranged for a herd of female bison originating from the American Prairie Reserve to be sent to the Colorado State University's Animal Reproduction & Biotechnology Laboratory to be used as surrogates in an attempt to transfer the fertilized embryos of genetically pure bison. After an ultrasound showed one female to be pregnant, the herd was moved to the zoo where, on June 20, 2012, the calf was born. The herd is kept in an off-exhibit section of the zoo and the goal is to eventually create a breeding herd of genetically pure bison through embryo transfers with the surrogate hybrid bison.[142]\n",
      "In 1981, the zoo successfully implanted a gaur embryo into a Holstein cow in an attempt to clone the endangered species.[5][143]\n",
      "In 1990, the zoo experienced a pest problem with the Canada goose. The park had become so over-crowded with the geese, that the zoo had to take action to decrease their numbers. Apart from their presence, the geese were very aggressive towards other birds and occasionally carried diseases into the park. To cope with the problem, the zoo hired a sharpshooter, who killed 19 geese. Zoo workers also destroyed 144 eggs found on the property. In 1991, the zoo employed a gentler method of sterilizing the birds.[144]\n",
      "In 2005, the zoo sent the frozen sperm of a male Indian rhinoceros to the Cincinnati Zoo where, four years later in 2009, it was thawed out and used in the first successful artificial insemination of the species when a calf was born in late 2010.[145] The calf did not survive long-term.\n",
      "In August 2006, the zoo adopted an orphaned snow leopard cub, named Leo. The 13-month-old cub was found stuck in mud following a landslide in Naltar Valley in Pakistan. The landslide had killed the cub's mother. A Pakistani shepherd in the area found the cub with its female sibling, but the female had died a week later due to malnutrition. He then handed over the male cub to Pakistani authorities to care for him. Since there are no captive breeding programs or rehabilitation centers for snow leopards in Pakistan, the authorities decided to send the cub to the Bronx Zoo. The cat will be returned to its place of birth following construction of a rehab facility in the Naltar Valley with cooperation from the United States.[6][146][147][148] On April 9, 2013, Leo sired a cub. He was the first cub of Leo.[149]\n",
      "In 2007, the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild. In July 2009, the zoo announced that the reintroduced alligators had begun breeding naturally in the wild, producing 15 hatchlings. The breeding was a milestone in the zoo's 10-year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China.[150]\n",
      "In January 2010, the zoo adopted four abandoned brown bear cubs. Three of the bears, two males and one female, were siblings born in 2009 and rescued from the ABC Islands in Alaska. The cubs were named Kootz, Denali, and Sitka. The fourth cub, a grizzly bear born in 2008, was rescued from Glacier National Park in Montana and named Glacier after the park.[49] In 2015, two other rescued grizzly bears, who had been at the zoo since 1995, were sent to one of the zoo's partner institutions, the Central Park Zoo.[50]\n",
      "The next month, an \"assurance colony\" of Kihansi spray toads was placed in the zoo. The species disappeared in their native Tanzania home.[151]\n",
      "In February 2011, the zoo took in two bald eagles that were rescued in Wyoming. The 5-year-old male was found in 2008 and was believed to have been hit by a car. The 3-year-old female was believed to have been injured during a storm. The birds were taken in by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and sent to the Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey for evaluation and care, where it was decided they were unable to survive in the wild.[80]\n",
      "In December 2012, five Chinese yellow-headed box turtles, a critically endangered species, were born.[152]\n",
      "In December 2015, the zoo rescued a juvenile Indian cobra which had stowed away on a cargo ship destined for New Jersey. The snake was found in poor condition being dehydrated, cold, and exposed to oil residue. The animal was brought to the zoo for recovery. It's unclear how the snake got onto the ship since it set out from Singapore, which is outside of the species' natural range.[153]\n",
      "On July 29, 1985, two female Siberian tigers killed 24-year-old animal keeper Robin Silverman after she entered their enclosure with a volunteer aide.[154] It was unclear why Silverman entered the enclosure; the zoo's general curator suspected a lapse in Silverman's concentration, while her family suspected a failure on the part of the zoo. It was the first and only human fatality in the zoo's history.[155]\n",
      "In the early 2000s, the zoo added a troop of Javan langurs to JungleWorld and mixed them with oriental small-clawed otters. The otters had previously mixed with other primate species in the enclosure without any problems. However, the new langurs made a habit of constantly bothering and attacking the otters. In June 2007 a group of otters grabbed a langur that was sitting at the water's edge and proceeded to overpower, then drown it in full view of visitors. A keeper on the viewing deck attempted to break up the fight by whistling and yelling at the otters, to no avail. After killing the langur, the otters left the body floating in the pool. It was later removed by keepers. Part of the incident was recorded and uploaded to YouTube.[156]\n",
      "Soon after the incident, the otters were removed from the enclosure and given their own in the Children's Zoo and elsewhere in JungleWorld.[citation needed]\n",
      "In 1902, a seven-month-old male jaguar broke out of his cage and escaped.[5]\n",
      "In July 1957, a platypus named Penelope who had recently made headlines for faking a pregnancy disappeared, abandoning her mate Cecil. Zookeepers searched the premises but found no evidence of her.[157]\n",
      "In February 1995, the zoo's De Jur Aviary collapsed during a snowstorm with about 100 seabirds, including Inca terns and gulls, inside. During the collapse, some of the residents flew off and escaped. In total, about 30 birds were lost.[66]\n",
      "On March 26, 2011, the Bronx Zoo announced that World of Reptiles was closed after a venomous adolescent cobra was discovered missing from its off-exhibit enclosure on March 25. Zoo officials were confident the missing cobra would be found in the building and not outside, since the species is known to be uncomfortable in open areas.[158] The missing snake quickly sparked a popular Twitter parody account, @BronxZoosCobra,[159] which narrated the daily hijinks of the cobra.[160] On March 31, zoo authorities found the snake in a non-public area of the reptile house.[161]\n",
      "On May 9, 2011, a female green peafowl escaped from the zoo before being caught on May 11.[162]\n",
      "On September 11, 2011, a lesser kudu escaped from its enclosure for about half an hour and then returned to its enclosure once a zoo worker opened the gate.[163]\n",
      "On April 26, 2023, an Indian peafowl given the nickname Raul escaped from the zoo and reportedly bit a man, although those reports were never confirmed. Raul flew back into the zoo at 11:17am the next day.[164]\n",
      "In the early 1970s, seven Indian elephants, named after the Seven Dwarfs from Snow White, were captured as calves in Thailand and dispersed among multiple U.S. zoos and circuses. Two of those calves, named Grumpy and Happy, were brought to the zoo in 1977. Over the next 25 years, the pair lived together, separated from the zoo's other elephants. In July 2002, the zoo attempted to mix the pair with two females, Patty and Maxine. However, the introduction failed when Patty and Maxine attacked the pair and injured Grumpy. Over the next several months, the elephant's injuries worsened and, in October of that year, the zoo was forced to euthanize her. With her lifelong companion gone, Happy was paired with the zoo's younger female, Sammy, whose companion Tus had also died in 2002. The two got along very well until Sammy developed severe liver disease and was also euthanized in early 2006. This left Patty, Maxine, and Happy as the zoo's only remaining elephants.[165]\n",
      "Despite the fact that elephants are highly social animals, the zoo decided that making a second attempt at introducing Happy to the others was too risky, with there being too high a chance that she would be attacked. She has since lived without the company of other elephants. Due to this, the zoo has been criticized by multiple animal rights organizations for supposedly mistreating Happy. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed a formal complaint against the zoo with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), calling for them to strip the zoo of its accreditation. In Defense of Animals (IDA) has named the zoo the \"Hall of Shame Winner\" on their 2015, 2016, and 2017 'Ten Worst Zoos for Elephants'.[166] IDA listed the zoo fourth on their 2012 list,[167] fifth on their 2013 and 2014 lists,[168][169] and eighth on their 2009 list.[170] The organizations, as well as many online petitions (some of which gain up to 200,000 supporters), have called on the zoo to send Happy to an elephant sanctuary. However, the zoo said that moving her at this stage in her life might be potentially traumatizing for her, and that she has very strong bonds with her keepers and is well-adjusted to the zoo, where she has spent well over thirty years of her life.[165][171]\n",
      "In 2012, a reporter for the New York Post wrote that she is kept inside all year and in solitary confinement. The zoo claims that she and the other two elephants have equal access to outdoor yards, and that the three elephants have limited interactions with each other and extensive interactions with zoo keepers. All three animals share the same barn, but Happy lives in separate stalls and yards.[171] In late 2018, one of the zoo's other elephants, Maxine, was euthanized due to complications with her liver and kidneys.[172]\n",
      "A lawsuit against the Bronx Zoo, stating that Happy was legally \"a person with a right to be free\", was dismissed in February 2020 by a judge of the Bronx County Supreme Court.[173] However, in May 2021, the New York Court of Appeals agreed to hear the appeal, filed on behalf of Happy by the Nonhuman Rights Project.[174] In June 2022, the Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of the zoo, saying in a 5–2 decision that the writ of habeas corpus did not apply to nonhuman animals.[175][176]\n",
      "In 1906, Ota Benga, a man from the Mbuti pygmy ethnic group, was brought to the zoo by the American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner, and displayed there as an exhibit; though he was allowed to roam the grounds freely. He became fond of an orangutan named Dohong, \"the presiding genius of the Monkey House\", who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior.[177]: 172–174  The events leading to his \"exhibition\" alongside Dohong were gradual. Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, where the zoo encouraged him to hang his hammock and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House.[178] Soon, a sign on the exhibit read:\n",
      "The African Pigmy, \"Ota Benga.\"\n",
      "Age, 23 years. Height, 4 feet 11 inches.\n",
      "Weight, 103 pounds. Brought from the\n",
      "Kasai River, Congo Free State, South\n",
      "Central Africa, by Dr. Samuel P. Verner.\n",
      "Exhibited each afternoon during September.[179]\n",
      "Hornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by Madison Grant, secretary of the New York Zoological Society, who lobbied to put Benga on-display alongside apes at the zoo. A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a racial anthropologist and eugenicist.[177]: 173–175 \n",
      "African-American clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. James H. Gordon said, \"Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.\"[178] Gordon also thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and a promotion of Darwinism: \"The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.\"[178] A number of clergymen backed Gordon.[180]: 47  In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in The New York Times suggested:\n",
      "We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter ... It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering. The pygmies ... are very low in the human scale, and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place ... from which he could draw no advantage whatever. The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date.[180]: 48 Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent.[181]: Chapter on Ota Benga  Around this time, Rev. Dr. R. MacArthur of Calvary Baptist Church, was quoted in The New York Times saying: \"It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him.\" Soon, the zoo removed Benga from the grounds.[179][182] Benga died by suicide in 1916 at the age of 32.[183] In 2020, WCS apologized for the zoo's treatment of Benga and promotion of eugenics.[184]\n",

      "The Bronx Museum of the Arts (BxMA), also called the Bronx Museum of Art[2] or simply the Bronx Museum,[3] is an American cultural institution located in Concourse, Bronx, New York. The museum focuses on contemporary and 20th-century works created by American artists, but it has hosted exhibitions of art and design from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Its permanent collection consists of more than 800 paintings, sculptures, photographs, and works on paper.[4] The museum is part of the Grand Concourse Historic District.[5]\n",
      "The Bronx Museum of the Arts was originally opened to try to stir interest in the arts in the Bronx borough and to serve the diverse populations of the area.[6] The museum opened on May 11, 1971, in a partnership between the Bronx Council on the Arts, which was founded in 1961, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[2][7] The opening coincided with a borough-wide \"Bronx Day\" event.[8] The first exhibit consisted of 28 paintings from the Met's collection.[2] The museum was originally housed in the first floor rotunda (the Veteran's Memorial Hall) of the Bronx County Courthouse, converted using $77,000 in municipal funds.[2][7][9] Additional galleries were located in the Bronx's Co-op City, Bedford Park, and Allerton neighborhoods, with the Allerton gallery was located in the Beth Abraham Hospital.[10] In its first 12 years of operation, the museum held over 350 exhibitions.[10]\n",
      "In 1982, the city purchased a vacant synagogue at 165th Street and the Grand Concourse[11] as a new location for the museum.[4][5][9] The new location opened to the public in May 1983, in conjunction with \"Bronx Week,\" which succeeded \"Bronx Day.\"[10][12] The new space was inaugurated with an exhibition of twentieth century artwork. It consisted of paintings, photographs, and prints borrowed form the Met.[13] An expansion and renovation was completed in 1988 at the cost of $5.8 million.[9][1][14]\n",
      "In February 2004, construction began on a $19 million expansion project that doubled the museum's size to 33,000 square feet (3,100 m2). The expansion opened in October 2006.[3][9][15] In 2008, a 3,000-square-foot (280 m2) arts center was added to accommodate educational programs for local schoolchildren and their families.[16] Beginning on March 29, 2012, the museum ceased charging admission for all days, whereas previously, admission was free on Fridays only.[17]\n",

      "The 1988 expansion was designed by Castro-Blanco, Piscioneri & Feder, who renovated the building exterior with black granite and metal, added large continuous \"ribbon windows\" on the facade, and  built a three-story glass atrium at one of the corners, which serves as the museum lobby.[5][9][11][1][14][18][19] The 1988 design has been described as \"awkward\"[11] and \"darksome\"[14] with \"cramped balconies\" and a cornerside entrance that give it a \"suburban mall\" feel.[11] It has also been criticized due to its lack of exhibition space.[11][14][20]\n",
      "The 2006 expansion at 1046 Grand Concourse was designed by Miami-based architecture firm Arquitectonica, which added the three-story North Wing building adjacent to the original structure. It features a larger entrance with a two-story lobby, a new gallery and enhanced educational facilities.[5][9][15][11][18] The outer design uses a \"pleated aluminum facade\" in contemporary Art Deco/Art Moderne style. It consists of seven irregularly-shaped vertical aluminum pieces connected by fritted glass, resembling an accordion or paper fan.[5][11][20][21] The side of the structure features black and white concrete blocks organized in geometric patterns, similar to the brick facades of rowhouses and commercial buildings in the Bronx.[5][14][20][22] These walls are temporary, designed to be removed in the event of future expansion, which would replace the original museum with a residential high-rise building.[5][20][21][22] At the rear of the structure on the second floor is a sculpture garden.[23] This new expansion has been described as \"a white box with raw concrete floors\" that, although \"institutional,\" serves its purpose of being accessible to all visitors.[11][14]\n",

      "Pelham Bay Park is a municipal park located in the northeast corner of the New York City borough of the Bronx. It is, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha),[a] the largest public park in New York City. The park is more than three times the size of Manhattan's Central Park. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks).\n",
      "Pelham Bay Park contains many geographical features, both natural and man-made. The park includes several peninsulas, including Rodman's Neck, Tallapoosa Point, and the former Hunter and Twin Islands. A lagoon runs through the center of Pelham Bay Park, and Eastchester Bay splits the southwestern corner from the rest of the park. There are also several recreational areas within the park.  Orchard Beach runs along Pelham Bay on the park's eastern shore. Two golf courses and various nature trails are located within the park's central section. Other landmarks include the Bartow-Pell Mansion, a city landmark, as well as the Bronx Victory Column & Memorial Grove.\n",
      "Before its creation, the land comprising the current Pelham Bay Park was part of Anne Hutchinson's short-lived dissident colony. Part of New Netherland, it was destroyed in 1643 by a Siwanoy attack in reprisal for the unrelated massacres carried out under Willem Kieft's direction of the Dutch West India Company's New Amsterdam colony.  In 1654 an Englishman named Thomas Pell purchased 50,000 acres (20,000 ha) from the Siwanoy, land which would become known as Pelham Manor after Charles II's 1666 charter. During the American Revolutionary War, the land was a buffer between British-held New York City and rebel-held Westchester, serving as the site of the Battle of Pell's Point, where Massachusetts militia hiding behind stone walls (still visible at one of the park's golf courses) stopped a British advance.\n",
      "The park was created in 1888, under the auspices of the Bronx Parks Department, largely inspired by the vision of John Mullaly, and passed to New York City when the part of the Bronx east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895.  Orchard Beach, one of the city's most popular, was created through the efforts of Robert Moses in the 1930s.\n",
      "Before the colonization of what is now New York State in the 17th century, Pelham Bay Park comprised an archipelago of islands separated by salt marshes and peninsular beaches.[6] Geologically, most of the park's land first formed during the end of the last ice age, the Wisconsin glaciation, which occurred 10,000 to 15,000 years before the first colonists arrived. The melting of the glaciers caused the formation of the current marshes. Sea level rise from the melting glaciers caused sedimentation along the shore, creating sand and mud flats. Gradually, saltwater cordgrass started to retain sediment, causing some of the inland marshes to flood only during high tide.[7]\n",
      "The Siwanoy (transliterated as \"southern people\") were the first Native American tribe to inhabit the Long Island Sound's northern shoreline east to Connecticut. They lived a mostly hunter-gatherer existence.[8][9] The Siwanoy used the modern-day park site as a ceremonial and burial site, as evidenced by the wampum belts found in the area,[10] which were used for diplomatic purposes among local Native American tribes.[11] Two glacial erratics in the park, deposited during the end of the last ice age, were used ceremonially by the Siwanoy: the \"Gray Mare\" on Hunter Island, and Mishow near the Theodore Kazimiroff Nature Trail.[8]\n",
      "The Dutch West India Company purchased the land in 1639.[11] They called it Vreedelandt, which translates to \"land of peace\",[9][12] and alternatively Oostdorp, meaning \"east village\".[12] Oostdorp became the area known as Westchester Square, to the southwest of the current park.[13][14]\n",
      "In 1642, Anne Hutchinson and her family moved from Rhode Island to Split Rock, along the Hutchinson River in what is now Pelham Bay Park. Although the family was English, the land was part of New Netherland under Dutch authority.[15] The exact location of the Hutchinson house is unknown, with one scholar saying that the house was in the modern-day park on the east side of the Hutchinson River,[16]: 231  and another saying that the house was on the west side of the river in now Baychester.[17] The Siwanoy destroyed the Hutchinson settlement and killed the family in August 1643,[16]: 239 [18] in reprisal for the unrelated massacres carried out under Willem Kieft's direction of the Dutch West India Company's New Amsterdam colony.[19][16]: 237 [15]\n",
      "In 1654 an Englishman named Thomas Pell purchased 50,000 acres (20,000 ha) from the Siwanoy, comprising the land of the current Pelham Bay Park as well as the nearby town of Pelham, New York, and made his estate on 9,188 acres (3,718 ha) of that land.[20][21] The current park consists of the southernmost portion of Pell's estate, excluding Hart Island and City Island.[22] Pell's land became known as Pelham Manor after Charles II's 1666 charter,[21][23] and parts of Pell's land claim were in conflict with that of other nearby settlers.[13] Pell died in 1669, willing his property to his nephew John,[13][24] who sold off City Island in 1685.[13] The land grant was renewed in 1687.[21] The next year, Jacob Leisler bought 6,000 acres (2,400 ha) of the remaining property on behalf of the Huguenots, and with that land, founded the town of New Rochelle for the Huguenots.[13][22] Upon John Pell's death in 1700, he willed the property to his son Joseph, who in turn transferred ownership to his own son, John. Ownership of the manor then went to the Bartow family,[25] who were maternal descendants of the Pell family.[12] The Pell family burial plot faced the Pelham Bay waterfront on the eastern side of the manor.[26][27]\n",
      "The land was the site of the Battle of Pell's Point during the American Revolutionary War.[28] After the British forces unsuccessfully attempted to trap the main body of the Continental Army on the island of Manhattan, British Army commander-in-chief General Sir William Howe looked for another location along Long Island Sound to disembark his troops.[29]: 246, 255  On October 18, 1776, he landed 4,000 men at Pelham, close to the current park.[30]: 5  A brigade of 750 men under the command of the American Colonel John Glover were already inland, and they attacked the British advance units from behind a series of stone walls.[30]: 14–17  After a series of attacks, the British broke off, and the Americans retreated.[29]: 255 [20][31]\n",
      "In 1836, Robert Bartow, a descendant of Thomas Pell,[3] bought 30 acres (12 ha) of his ancestor's old estate. By 1842, construction was complete on the Bartow-Pell Mansion, the family's manor.[32] Bartow died in 1868, and his family sold the mansion to the city in the 1880s.[32] The mansion was vacant until 1915, when the city and International Garden Club assumed joint maintenance of the building.[32][33]\n",
      "In the 1870s, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned a greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid.[34][35] However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.[36] Around the same time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881.[37][38] There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site.[39][40] However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house).[41][42] In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system.[41][43]\n",
      "Legal disputes carried on for years. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure, and that everyone in the city would need to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction, regardless of whether they lived near the parks. In particular, Pelham Bay Park was located within Westchester County at the time, out of city limits.[44] The city was reluctant to pay to buy the parkland because of the cost and locations.[45] Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens; that the value of properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the Pelham Bay Park site could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established, owing to efforts from supporters.[44]\n",
      "After much litigation, the city acquired the land for the park.[45] Although the residents of Pelham had initially supported the park's creation, they came to oppose it when they found that the park's creation would decrease the town's tax revenue.[46] The 1,700 acres of land for the park were part of the town's 3,000-acre (1,200 ha) area at that time, but could not be taxed, nearly halving the town's tax revenues from land area. One Pelham resident's letter to New York City Mayor Abram Hewitt, asking for financial assistance to supplement the town's growing tax rate, was published in The New York Times in February 1887.[47] A month later, a group of Pelham residents petitioned Hewitt to oppose the park plan.[48][46] The government of New York City also did not want to pay taxes to the town of Pelham if it bought the land for the park, which had been one of the reasons for its initial opposition to acquiring the land.[49] There was a proposal to have New York City pay taxes to Pelham if it acquired the land, which the city's Tax Department called \"entirely novel, and of course, wrong\".[50]\n",
      "Despite Pelham residents' opposition to the park, the city acquired the land for Pelham Bay Park in 1887, and it officially became a park in 1888.[51]: 693 [45] Pelham Bay Park became a recreation area under the auspices of the Bronx Parks Department,[52] which bought the land for $2,746,688, equivalent to $93,143,242 in 2023.[9] The park used land from multiple estates spread out over an excess of 1,700 acres (690 ha).[9][45][53] Some of the old estates' mansions were still standing twenty years later.[54] To alleviate the concerns of Westchester property owners who lost land during the park system's acquisition, the New York City Commissioners of Estimate distributed compensation payments.[51]: 694  The Commissioners of Estimate paid a combined $9 million (equivalent to $305,200,000 in 2023), but some land owners sued for more compensation in 1889.[55]\n",
      "In 1890, Mullaly proposed using the site for the 1893 World's Fair due to its size;[56] however, the fair was eventually awarded to Chicago instead.[57] The Pell family's burial vault was also marked for preservation that year,[58]: 34 (PDF p.135)  and in July 1891, the descendants of the Pell family were given permission to maintain and restore the plot.[59]: 70 (PDF p.128)  After the park opened, several individuals were allowed to reside in the mansions within the park. In 1892, the New York City Department of Public Parks separately allowed the occupation of the Hunter, Hoyt, and Twin Island houses.[60]: 9 (PDF p.67), 32 (PDF p.89), 109 (PDF p.193)  The next year, two buildings near Pelham Bridge were auctioned off.[61]: 404 (PDF p.471) \n",
      "Pelham Bay Park's ownership was passed to New York City when the part of the Bronx east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895.[53] Despite the park being for public use, some of the old estates remained standing, with a few occupied by private families. Due to its distance from the city, NYC Parks decided to keep 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) of Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt Parks in their natural state, unlike some of the other parks closer to Manhattan, which were being extensively landscaped.[62]: PDF pp.442–443  None of the houses were rented in 1899,[63]: 23  but by 1900, thirty-six houses in the park were being used as private residences, comprising 75% of houses rented within parks in the Bronx.[64]: 20  This number dropped to thirty-three the next year.[65]: 65 \n",
      "In spring 1902, NYC Parks destroyed two houses in the park and used the remaining wood to build free bathhouses, which were used by about 700 bathers per day during that summer.[66]: 116 (PDF p.85)  Around 1903, Hunter Island became a popular summer vacation destination.[67][68] Due to overcrowding on Hunter Island, NYC Parks opened a campsite two years later at Rodman's Neck on the south tip of the island, with 100 bathhouses.[68][45][53][69] Orchard Beach, at the time a tiny recreational area on the northeast tip of Rodman's Neck,[70] was expanded that year.[69]  In 1904, an athletic field was opened within Pelham Bay Park.[71]\n",
      "By 1917, Hunter Island saw half a million seasonal visitors.[68] Orchard Beach also became popular, with an average of 2,000 visitors on summer weekdays and 5,000 visitors on summer weekends in 1912.[45] However, the park's condition started to decline in the 1920s as the surrounding areas were developed. The park facilities were dirty and deteriorating due to overuse, and there was a lot of vandalism.[45][53] Hunter Island was closed and camping was banned, so some park patrons began camping illegally.[72]\n",
      "The current Orchard Beach recreational area and Split Rock golf course was created through the efforts of New York City park commissioner Robert Moses.[73][3][74] Immediately after assuming his position in 1934, Moses ordered engineers to inventory every park in the city to see what needed renovating.[75] He devised plans for a new Orchard Beach recreation area after he saw the popularity of the Hunter Island campsite.[68] On February 11, 1934, Moses announced a plan for the new golf course.[73] Two weeks later, he announced another plan for the upgraded beach, which had been inspired by the design of Jones Beach on Long Island.[76] The beach and existing golf course would be reconstructed through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) under the 1930s New Deal program.[3][77][73][78]\n",
      "Moses canceled 625 leases for the project, and after campers unsuccessfully sued the city,[79] the site was cleared of campers in June.[80] Moses decided to connect Hunter Island and the Twin Islands to Rodman's Neck by filling in most of LeRoy's Bay.[70] The deteriorated Hunter Mansion was demolished with the construction of the beach.[81] The golf courses were reopened in June 1935, sixteen months after construction commenced. John van Kleek designed the brand-new Split Rock golf course as part of the city's program to upgrade or build ten golf courses around the city.[82][83]\n",
      "A final design for the beach was unveiled in July 1935.[84][85][86] The beach project involved filling in approximately 110 acres (45 ha) of LeRoy's and Pelham Bays with landfill,[3] followed by a total of 4,000,000 cubic yards (3,100,000 m3) of sand.[87][88] Moses thought that waste from the New York City Department of Sanitation would be cheaper than sand.[87] In early 1935, workers began placing the garbage fill[89] around Rodman's Neck, Twin Island, and Hunter Island.[89][90] After the garbage began washing onto the beach, the rest of the site was filled-in using sand starting in 1936.[87][91] The beach, designed by Gilmore David Clarke and Aymar Embury II, was dedicated in July 1936[74][90] despite only being partially complete.[92][93] The beach officially opened on June 25, 1937.[94] Soon after Orchard Beach opened, it was expanded, starting with the southern locker room in 1939.[95][96] The water between Hunter and Twin Islands was filled in during 1946 and 1947, with new jetties at each end of the beach. The promenade was extended over the fill and opened in 1947,[97][72][68][98] Further improvements were made to the bathhouse pavilion in 1952 and to the northern jetty in 1955. A new concession stand was added north of the pavilion in 1962,[97] and a privately funded Golf driving range was also added that year.[99] The beach was renovated starting in 1964.[100]\n",
      "In 1959, after the Rodman's Neck section of the park had been used for various purposes, the New York City Police Department used land from the park to create the Rodman's Neck Firing Range at the southern tip of the peninsula. Previously, the parkland at Rodman's Neck had been underused, with the NYPD and United States Army using the land at various times.[101][102]\n",
      "The City began landfill operations on Tallapoosa Point in Pelham Bay Park in 1963.[103][104] Plans to expand the landfills in Pelham Bay Park in 1966, which would have created the City's second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island, were met with widespread community opposition.[103] The landfill expansion was seen as a way to alleviate the city's accumulations of waste, and Tallapoosa was seen as the only suitable location to put the landfill.[105] The preservation effort was headed by Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff, a Bronx historian and head of The Bronx County Historical Society. It suffered setbacks in August 1967 when the New York City Board of Estimate voted against an initial effort to create to protected area in the proposed landfill expansion site.[106][107] However, the state and federal governments did not favor the landfill being located at Tallapoosa.[108] In October, Mayor John Lindsay signed a law authorizing in the creation of two wildlife refuges, the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, on the site where the landfill was planned to be expanded.[103] Tallapoosa West continued to be used as a landfill until May 1968, when the landfill permit was revoked.[105] In November of that year, Tallapoosa West was made a part of the Pell refuge.[109] The dump was still operating as late as 1975, when the garbage there was described as being ten stories high.[110] The landfill closed in 1978.[104] However, a report published in 1983 claimed that the Tallapoosa landfill, as well as five others throughout the city, was heavily contaminated with \"toxic wastes\" dumped from 1964 to 1979.[111][112] The waste from the landfill reportedly led to health problems for residents of nearby communities such as Country Club. The Tallapoosa landfill at Pelham Bay Park was designated a hazardous-waste site in 1988, and cleanup began in 1989.[104]\n",
      "In 1983, the Theodore Kazimiroff Environmental Center was proposed for the park, alongside a nature trail that would wind through the park's terrain.[113] It would be named out of respect to the late historian,[113] who had died in 1980.[114] The Kazimiroff Nature Trail and the Pelham Bay Park Environmental Center opened in June 1986.[115][114][72] A $1 million renovation of the Orchard Beach pavilions (equivalent to $2,780,000 in 2023) was completed by 1986.[116] By the end of the decade, large numbers of human and animal remains were being dumped in Pelham Bay Park, including 65 human bodies that were dumped in the park from 1986 to 1995. Pelham Bay Park was also very dirty, and discarded trash from several decades prior was still visible.[117] NYPD officers on these cases theorized that the frequency of body dumpings might be attributable to two things: the park's remote location near highways, as well as a belief that the parkland is haunted by the remains of the Siwanoy buried there.[118]\n",
      "In 1990, NYC Parks received a $6.3 million gift for improvements to Pelham Bay Park and twenty other parks around the city. NYC Parks used the money to renovate trails and clean up weeds.[119] A renovation of Orchard Beach started in 1995.[120] A water park for the beach was proposed, but ultimately canceled in 1999.[121] A few years later, as part of the city's ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, several facilities in Pelham Bay Park were proposed for upgrades. The new facilities would have included a shooting center at Rodman's Neck; a 350-meter (1,150 ft) horseback riding track; and a fencing, swimming, and water polo facility in the Orchard Beach pavilion.[122] The bid ultimately was awarded to London instead.[123]\n",
      "In 2010, construction began on extending the jetty at Orchard Beach at a cost of $13 million.[124][125] Soon after, work started on a $2.9 million project to restore Pelham Bay Park's shoreline, which entailed renovating the seawall, adding a dog run, and creating a new walking trail.[126] In 2012, Native American shell middens were found at Tallapoosa Point, prompting an archaeological investigation.[127] Further digs at the site uncovered more than a hundred artifacts, some of which dated to the third century CE. Work on the restoration project was paused in June 2015 as a result of the finds.[126][128] The restoration project was restarted in September 2015.[129]\n",
      "At 2,772 acres (1,122 ha),[a] Pelham Bay Park is the city's largest,[5][130] being slightly more than three times the size of the 843-acre (341 ha) Central Park.[131][5] Pelham Bay Park includes 13 miles (21 km) of shoreline[131] as well as land on both sides of the Hutchinson River. Hunter Island, Twin Island, and Two-Trees Island, all formerly true islands in Pelham Bay, are now connected to the mainland by fill, and are part of the park.[2] Several islands in the Long Island Sound (including the Chimney Sweeps Islands),[132] as well as Goose Island in the Hutchinson River, are also part of Pelham Bay Park.[133] The park is divided into several sections, including two main sections roughly divided by Eastchester Bay.[134][135]\n",
      "In the eastern section of Pelham Bay Park is Orchard Beach and its parking lot. The eastern section also contains the Hunter Island Wildlife Sanctuary on Twin and Hunter Islands. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail winds through this section.[135] The northwestern section, divided from the eastern section via the Lagoon. It contains both golf courses, as well as the Thomas Pell Sanctuary; the Bartow-Pell Woods; Goose Creek Marsh; and the Siwanoy, Bridle, and Split Rock Trails. The park is crossed by Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad at this location, as well as by the Hutchinson River Parkway and New England Thruway.[135] A central section contains a Central Woodland, where the Siwanoy Trail and Turtle Cove Driving Range is present. It also includes Rodman's Neck as well as a portion of the park known as \"The Meadow\".[135] The Pelham Bridge carries traffic across the Eastchester Bay between the southwest section and the rest of the park.[135]\n",
      "The park contains many different habitats. The largest habitat is the 782-acre (316 ha) forests, followed by the 195-acre (79 ha) salt marshes, the 161-acre (65 ha) salt flats, the 83-acre (34 ha) meadows,  the 751-acre (304 ha) mixed scrub, and the 3-acre (1.2 ha) fresh water marsh.[136] In total, about 67% of the park is estimated to be in its natural state, while 33% of the park is estimated to be developed.[137]: 129  In the latter half of the 20th century, Pelham Bay Park's biodiversity decreased: in that time, the park was observed to have lost 25% of its 569 native species of plants as well as 12.5% of its 321 non-native species.[137]: 132 \n",

The Siwanoy referred to the island as \"Laap-Ha-Wach King\", or \"place of stringing beads\".[81][138] The island was then renamed after John Hunter, a successful businessman and politician, who purchased the property in 1804[139] and moved his family to the island in 1813.[140] They built a mansion in the English Georgian style[138][141] at the highest point on the island (90 feet above sea level).[81] The mansion was destroyed in 1937 during the construction of Orchard Beach.[81][140] In 1967, the island became part of the Hunter Island Wildlife Sanctuary.[81]\n",

The East and West Twin Islands (or the \"Twins\") were once true islands in Pelham Bay but are now connected to each other and to Orchard Beach and nearby Rodman's Neck by a landfill created in 1937.[138][142][143] East Twin Island, a rocky formation with \"ribbons of color\" caused by sedimentary erosion, is connected to neighboring Two Trees Island via a thin mudflat land bridge. Two Trees Island itself consists of a rocky plateau upon which one can see Orchard Beach and the environmental center.[142] West Twin Island was at one time connected to neighboring Hunter Island via a man-made stone bridge,[144][145] which now lies in ruins in one of the city's last remaining salt marshes.[146]\n",
      "The two islands that are now combined as Twin Island have been owned by NYC Parks since the 1888 acquisition of Pelham Bay Park.[145] A tennis court was built on the island in 1899.[63]: 26  Twin Island was restored in 1995 as part of the Twin Islands Salt Marsh Restoration Project, which cost $850,000.[146]\n",

The southern third of the peninsula is used as a firing range by the New York City Police Department (NYPD); the remaining wooded section is part of Pelham Bay Park.[135][147] The north side, which is joined to the rest of Pelham Bay Park near Orchard Beach, contains several baseball fields.[135][148] Two small land berms between Rodman's Neck and City Island consist of the island's only connecting road to the mainland.[2]\n",
      "Rodman's Neck was part of the historic Pell property,[149] and since the city acquired the peninsula in 1888, it has been used for multiple purposes.[102] It was used as a United States Army training location during World War I,[101] and was converted to under-utilized parkland in the 1920s.[101][102]  From 1930 to 1936, the peninsula was incorporated as part of Camp Mulrooney, a summer camp for the NYPD.[101][102] The Army used Rodman's Neck again in the 1950s during the Cold War.[101] and the NYPD built the current firing range at the peninsula's southern tip in 1959.[101]\n",
      "Tallapoosa Point is located in the southwest of Pelham Bay Park, near the Pelham Bridge.[135] It used to be a separate island south of Eastchester Bay, having been private property, but was connected to the mainland during the colonial period. The point then became a popular fishing spot.[150] In 1879, the Tallapoosa Club political group started leasing part of the peninsula from the city during the summer, hosting activities there. The club's presence gave the peninsula its current name, and in turn, the club's name was derived from Tallapoosa, Georgia, where some of its members had fought during the American Civil War.[151] The Tallapoosa Club used a mansion originally built by the Lorillard family.[152] They used the mansion until October 1, 1895.[153]: 50 (PDF p.138) \n",
      "Tallapoosa Point was used as a dump from 1963[103] until 1968, when landfill operations ceased[105] and it became a part of the Wildlife Refuge.[109] Since then it has been a part of the park, but there was an obscure proposal in the 1970s to make Tallapoosa into a ski slope.[150] Tallapoosa Point was later re-planted and serves as a bird habitat.[154]\n",
      "Between City Island and Orchard Beach is a sound named Pelham Bay (40°51′59″N 73°47′25″W﻿ / ﻿40.866335°N 73.790321°W﻿ / 40.866335; -73.790321﻿ (Pelham Bay)), but contrary to its name, it is not a bay, but rather a sound since it is open to larger bodies of water at both ends. It connects to Eastchester Bay at the south, and opens onto Long Island Sound and City Island Harbor at the east.[135] Approximately one third of the original bay was filled in to create Orchard Beach from 1934 to 1938.[3]\n",
      "Eastchester Bay is a body of water that separates City Island and most of the park from the park's southwest portion and the rest of the Bronx.[135][155] It is crossed by the Pelham Bridge, which connects the two parts of the park.[155] It is technically also a sound, and the northern end connects via a narrow channel to Pelham Bay. The Hutchinson River empties into Eastchester Bay near the northern end. The lower portion of the bay opens onto the East River, Little Neck Bay, and Long Island Sound.[156]\n",
      "A lagoon within the park was once part of Pelham Bay, separating Hunter and Twin Islands from the mainland, and was called LeRoy's Bay until the mid-20th century. It was popular for rowing regattas,[157] but could not be used for regulation rowing races as it was blocked by the causeway to Hunter Island.[158] By 1902, there were calls to remove the causeway so LeRoy's Bay could be used as a raceway.[158] The New York City Department of Public Parks decided to create a \"temporary\" wooden bridge and remove the causeway to allow the bay's tides to flow freely.[159]\n",
      "Most of the lagoon was filled in during the mid-1930s reconstruction of Orchard Beach, and the bay became known as the \"Orchard Beach Lagoon\", or the Lagoon for short.[91][160] The lagoon between Orchard Beach and the Westchester border had been popular for regattas, or boat races, for decades, but it was neglected through the 1940s and 1950s. Rocks, weeds, and unwanted cars were tossed into the lagoon regularly.[161]\n",
      "The lagoon was chosen as the site of the 1964 Summer Olympics rowing trials,[2] at which point it was widened and dredged, becoming a four-lane, 2,000-meter (6,600 ft) rowing track.[162][163][164] The track, which cost $630,000,[162] was hosted jointly by the city and the organizers of the 1964 New York World's Fair. New York City hosted several of the 1964 Olympic trials at various locations as part of the World's Fair the same year.[163] Afterward, the now-unnamed lagoon was used by New York-area colleges for boating regattas, since it had been determined to be one of the most suitable locations for boat racing in the United States. Multiple colleges, including Columbia, Manhattan, St. John's, Fordham, Iona, and Yale, utilized the lagoon for collegiate rowing practice.[161]\n",
      "Turtle Cove is a small cove along the north side of City Island Road west of Orchard Beach Road.[135] Around the early 1900s, a land berm was created across Turtle Cove for rails for horsecars. This berm caused the north end of Turtle Cove to become mostly freshwater, which attracted freshwater drinking rare birds in the meadow. A 3-foot (0.91 m) diameter concrete culvert was placed across the berm to allow salt water from Eastchester Bay, but leaves and vegetation blocked this culvert.[133] Starting in June 2009, NYC Parks started a restoration project for the cove, removing the old culvert and digging a canal to flood the north end of the cove with salt water. NYC Parks then placed a foot bridge across the canal. Some 11 acres (4.5 ha) of forest were also restored, with 10,000 trees being replaced.[165] The cove also contains a batting cage and a golf center with miniature golf, PGA simulators, and grass tees.[166]\n",

Dawson (1886) and William Abbatt (1901) both wrote that Colonel John Glover reputedly stood on the rock and watched the British forces land during the battle.[168][30]: 255  This claim is erroneous, as these distances were computed based on an inaccurate map using estimates recorded by Glover in his \"Letter from Mile Square\" on October 24, 1776.[167] The actual location where Glover watched British forces land is closer to the second tee of the current Split Rock Golf Course.[167] The rock is only known as such today because Abbatt includes a labeled photograph of it in his book.[30]: 4 \n",

The Bridle Trail passes close to the rock, but is separated from the rock by the parkway's exit ramp.[135] Another park trail, called the Split Rock Trail, leads from the Bartow Circle to the rock.[170]The Split Rock Golf Course was named after the rock.[2] Split Rock also gives its name to Split Rock Road in Pelham Manor,[171] which used to extend into the park itself.[172] The rock appears to be a glacial erratic and derives its name from a large crevice dividing the stone into two half domes. The huge rock broke in half about 10,000 years ago under the stress of glacial movements.[173][174]\n",
      "Split Rock is also the location near where, in 1643, Anne Hutchinson and members of her family were massacred by Native Americans of the Siwanoy Tribe.  Her daughter, Susanna, the only member of the family to survive the massacre, was at the rock during the time of the attack, which took place at the house, a distance away.[16]: 237  In 1904, the New York State Legislature approved the placement of a bronze tablet on Split Rock in honor of Anne Hutchinson.[175] The tablet was installed in 1911 by the Colonial Dames of New York.[176][177] However, it was stolen in 1914.[178][179] The plaque reads:[179][180]\n",

In 1899, the New York Athletic Club approached Lawrence Van Etten, an architect renowned for designing golf courses, for a request to construct an 18-hole course within the park.[83] The proposed course would be bounded by Pelham Manor to the north; the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad (now Northeast Corridor) tracks to the west; and Shore Road to the southeast. The city was building Van Cortlandt Park's golf course at the time, but the Bronx district parks commissioner approved Van Etten's plan. Originally, the club wanted to construct a park on Hunter Island, but Van Etten felt that the island was too small for a full 18-hole course.[226] Once the Van Cortlandt Park course was opened, city officials started focusing on plans for the Pelham course.[227]\n",
      "In April 1900, surveyors began studying part of the park as a possible location for a golf course.[228][227] Later that month, workers began construction at the northwest course location. It was expected that the course would open in June or July of that year,[228][229] but that the work would not be fully complete until September.[227] New York City greenskeeper Val Flood later stated that he thought the course would open by August; however, by September 1900, work on the course had hardly started due to a lack of workers.[230] By the end of 1900, NYC Parks reported that seeds had been planted for nine greens, and two bunkers and one hazard had been created.[64]: 23  The course opened in 1901,[65]: 69  but did not gain popularity until 1903 when overcrowding at the Van Cortlandt course drove players to use the less crowded Pelham Bay course instead.[231]\n",

This comprised two 18-hole courses or four 9-hole courses. There was also a new two-story brick Greek Revival clubhouse adjacent to both of the 18-hole courses, with a golf store, Pro Shop, cafeteria, lockers, restrooms, and showers.

      "A nonprofit organization called Friends of Pelham Bay Park (founded in 1992) manages the park, while NYC Parks owns and operates the land and facilities.[241] Compared to the Central Park Conservancy, Friends of Pelham Bay Park does not receive as much funding.[242] Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park;[243] the earliest efforts for such a thing date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.[244]\n",
      "As part of the city's acquisition of Pelham Bay Park in 1888, NYC Parks claimed responsibility for maintenance over the western end of the City Island Bridge, which was within the park.[245]: 433 (PDF p.502) [51]: 695   The City Island Bridge had been built by the 1870s.[246] By 1892, the bridge was in need of maintenance,[60]: PDF p.114  and a proposal for a replacement bridge was approved in 1895.[62]: 41 (PDF p.115)  The replacement bridge started construction in late 1898 and was completed in 1901.[247]\n",

Planning for the new bridge started in 2005,[251] though a lack of funding delayed the start of construction to 2012.[252] The new bridge was completed in 2015, and the old one was demolished soon after.[253]\n",
      "The park is traversed by the Hutchinson River Parkway on its west side.[3] The New England Thruway (I-95), a partial toll road, also has a short highway section in the park's northwest corner.[209][135] A partial interchange between the two roads is located within the park.[209] To the south, an exit from the Hutchinson River Parkway provides direct access to the park, Orchard Beach, and City Island. The exit and entrance ramps lead east to the Bartow Circle, where the ramps intersect with Shore Road, which runs roughly southwest-northeast, and with Orchard Beach Road, which leads southeast to the Orchard Beach parking lot.[209] Slightly to the southwest of Bartow Circle is the T intersection of Shore Road and City Island Road, which marks the northwest terminus of the latter road. Shore Road continues across the Pelham Bridge to the southwest corner of the park, then turns west and continues onto Pelham Parkway.[209] Meanwhile, City Island Road continues southeast to City Island Circle, where it intersects with Park Drive, a road that connects to Orchard Beach Road in the north and Rodman's Neck in the south. City Island Road then continues southeast across the City Island Bridge to the eponymous island.[209]\n",
      "NYC Parks assumed responsibility for the park's roads in 1888 and gradually paved and expanded them over the following decades.[51]: 695  An expansion of Eastern Boulevard (later Shore Road) began in 1895.[62]: PDF p.175  In 1897, the city started extending Pelham Parkway through to Eastern Boulevard.[254]: 258 (PDF p.328)  By 1902, Eastern Boulevard was referred to as \"the Shore drive\" since it ran close to the LeRoy's Bay shore. The same year, NYC Parks built a 4,230-foot (1,290 m) dirt path, which connected Glover's Rock to Shore Road. Another 4,870-foot-long (1,480 m) dirt road to Pelham Bridge was also built, and a 6,485-foot (1,977 m) pedestrian path from City Island Bridge to Bartow Station was built.[66]: 116–117 (PDF pp.85–86) \n",
      "The Hutchinson River Parkway in Pelham Bay Park replaced the old Split Rock Road in the park. The original roadway was an undivided, limited-access parkway, designed with gently sloping curves, stone arch bridges, and wooden lightposts. The original 11-mile (18 km) section included bridle paths along the right-of-way. There was also a riding academy where the public could rent horses.[255] The parkway is named for Anne Hutchinson and her family, and passes through the part of the park near where the Hutchinsons were killed by the Siwanoy.[255] The modern-day parkway was extended south from Westchester through Pelham Bay Park in December 1937.[256][172]\n",

      "Pelham Bay Park is served by the New York City Subway at its eponymous station on the west side of the Bruckner Expressway,[258] which is served by the 6 and <6>​ trains.[259] The station is part of the former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s Pelham Line. The line's northern terminus is located at the southeast corner of Pelham Bay Park, and the IRT station there opened in December 1920.[260][261] An exit from the station leads onto a pedestrian bridge that crosses the expressway and leads directly to the park.[236][258]\n",

      "The Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad was chartered in 1866,[265] connecting the Harlem River in the south and Port Chester in the north. The railroad opened in 1873, with some portions passing through the current park.[266] The route, a branch of the New Haven Line operated by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, contained six stations. One of these stations, called alternatively City Island or Bartow, in Pelham (now part of the park).[267] In 1895, the railroad re-acquired some of the land from the park[153]: 205 (PDF p.297)  In 1906, ownership of the Shore Road overpass over the Harlem and Port Chester railroad line was transferred to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.[268]\n",
      "A railroad of some sort also connected City Island and Pelham Bay Park from 1887 to 1919. Originally composed of the separate Pelham Park Railroad Company and the City Island Railroad, the 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) narrow-gauge horsecar route was operated by the former of the two companies, which ran service between the Bartow station of the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad and Brown's Hotel on City Island. The 3.2-mile (5.1 km) route was complete by 1892.[269] The IRT absorbed the two companies in 1902 and started designing its own monorail in 1908.[269][270] The monorail's first journey in July 1910 ended with the monorail toppling on its side,[271][272][270] and although service resumed in November 1910, the monorail went into receivership in December 1911.[273] The monorail ceased operation on April 3, 1914,[274][275][276] and was subsequently sold to the Third Avenue Railway,[277] which abandoned the line on August 9, 1919.[278]\n",
      "The Harlem River and Port Chester tracks were maintained by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.[279]: 1092  New stations designed by Cass Gilbert were opened in 1908, but the line's stations were all closed by 1937, having suffered from low ridership.[276] During the late 20th century, the old Harlem River and Port Chester tracks went through a series of ownership changes, and in 1976, Amtrak bought the tracks and integrated the route into its Northeast Corridor.[279]: 81  The station house for the line's Bartow station still exists, albeit as a deteriorated shell;[280] the station's roof burned down after it was closed.[276] An overgrown path leads from the bridle trail to the former station site.[281]\n",
      "The city renovated the Shore Road railroad overpass in the early 2000s. Citing the 1906 deed that transferred the bridge's maintenance to the company that owned the railroad below it, the city then filed a lawsuit to make Amtrak pay for the renovation.

      "The Siwanoy Trail consists of a trail system that originates in the Central Woodlands section of the park. Originating at City Island Road, it bears to the northeast before splitting into two spurs, one going east to the Rodman's Neck meadow and the other going north around Bartow Circle. At the circle's eastern side, the trail splits again. One spur goes northeast in a self-closing loop to the Bartow-Pell Mansion, and the other goes northwest to connect to Split Rock Trail before going around the Hutchinson River Parkway's interchange with Orchard Beach Road.[135]\n",

      "Van Cortlandt Park is a 1,146-acre (464 ha) park located in the borough of the Bronx in New York City. Owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, it is managed with assistance from the Van Cortlandt Park Alliance. The park, the city's third-largest,[a] was named for the Van Cortlandt family, which was prominent in the area during the Dutch and English colonial periods.\n",
      "Van Cortlandt Park's sports facilities include golf courses and several miles of paths for running, as well as facilities for  baseball, basketball, cricket, cross-country running, football, horseback riding, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and track and field. The park also contains five major hiking trails and other walking trails. Its natural features include Tibbetts Brook; Van Cortlandt Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Bronx; old-growth forests; and outcrops of Fordham gneiss and Inwood marble. Contained within the park is the Van Cortlandt House, the oldest known surviving house in the Bronx, and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course, the oldest public golf course in the country.\n",
      "The land that Van Cortlandt Park now occupies was purchased by Jacobus Van Cortlandt from John Barrett around 1691. His son Frederick built the Van Cortlandt House on the property, but died before its completion. Later, the land was used during the Revolutionary War when the Stockbridge militia was destroyed by the Queen's Rangers. In 1888, the family property was sold to the City of New York and made into a public parkland. The Van Cortlandt House, later designated as a historic landmark, was converted into a public museum, and new paths were created across the property to make it more passable.\n",
      "In the 1930s, the Robert Moses–directed construction of the Henry Hudson Parkway and Mosholu Parkway fragmented Van Cortlandt Park into its six discontinuous pieces. The last remaining freshwater marsh in New York State, Tibbetts Brook, was dredged and landscaped to accommodate construction, causing large-scale ecological disruption within the park. The 1975 New York City fiscal crisis caused much of the park to fall into disrepair. Gradual improvements began taking place from the late 1980s on including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security. In 2014, the \"Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan 2034\" was published.\n",
      "The forest in what is now Van Cortlandt Park has been around for 17,000 years, since the end of the Wisconsin glaciation.[1]  The Wiechquaskeck, a Wappinger people, were among the first recorded people to inhabit in the area now referred to as Van Cortlandt Park. They settled in the area around the 14th or 15th centuries.[2] The Lenapes used the geographic features of the area to support their community; for instance, they used the Tibbetts Brook, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, or Hudson River for fishing, and flatland areas for farming. They formed a village named Keskeskick, whose name roughly translates to \"sharp grass or sedge marsh\" in the Unami language.[3]\n",
      "The strip of land on the Hudson River's east bank, between the current-day Spuyten Duyvil Creek and Yonkers, was sold to the Dutch West India Company in the early 17th century. Adriaen van der Donck, a Dutch settler, bought the land from the company in 1646.[4][5][6] Van der Donck also paid the Indian chief Tacharew, whose tribe used to live on the land, as a friendly gesture.[5][6][7][8] He named the land \"Colen Donck\" and built a house upon the land.[9] The house was built between current-day Van Cortlandt Lake and Broadway.[8] It faced south, probably because this was the location of a natural marshland.[10] What is now the parade ground was used by van der Donck for farming.[11]\n",
      "Van der Donck died in 1655.[5] That year the Munsee bands that lived in the lower Hudson River valley briefly occupied New Amsterdam and attacked Pavonia and Staten Island during what is known as the Peach War.[12] This forced the settlers, including van der Donck's widow, to flee to Manhattan.[5] Following the takeover of the New Netherland colony by the British in 1664, the claim to the estate was awarded to Hugh O'Neale, the new husband of van der Donck's widow.[13] Because the O'Neales lived far away from the land, the claim was awarded to O'Neale's brother-in-law and van der Donck's widow's brother, Elias Doughty, who proceeded to sell off the portions of the property.[5][14][13][15] In 1668,[13] a portion of the land was sold to William Betts, an English turner, and his son-in-law George Tippett, whom Tibbetts Brook would later be named for.[14][15][16] This property included the modern park parade grounds.[17] Next, Doughty sold a 2,000-acre (810 ha) tract of land, including the current site of the Van Cortlandt House, to Frederick Philipse, Thomas Delavall, and Thomas Lewis.[13] Philipse bought out Delavall's and Lewis's land shares, making the land part of the Philipsburg Manor, which extended from Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the Croton River in modern Westchester County.[5][14] Philipse's wife died, and he remarried Olof Stevense Van Cortlandt's daughter, herself a widow.[18] Philipse's daughter Eva later married Jacobus Van Cortlandt, who was Mrs. Philipse's brother.[5][14][18]\n",
      "The land that Van Cortlandt Park now occupies was acquired by Van Cortlandt from Philipse in the mid-to-late 1690s.[5][14][19][20][17] In 1699, Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook in order to power a sawmill (and later, a gristmill,[21][22]), creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process.[23][24][25] In 1732, Van Cortlandt acquired an additional parcel from the Tippett family.[17][26] The estate was then passed on to Jacobus's son Frederick Van Cortlandt (1699–1749) and family in 1739; it was once a vast grain plantation.[27]  In 1748, Frederick built the Van Cortlandt House on the former Tippett property, but died before its completion.[28][10][27][17] The Van Cortlandts did not primarily live in that house, instead staying in Manhattan most of the time.[10][27]  A family burial ground was created in 1749,[10] later to be known as \"Vault Hill.\"[29][30] Frederick, who was buried in Vault Hill,[29][30] had willed the massive home and surrounding lands to his son, James Van Cortlandt (1727–1787).[31]\n",
      "The Van Cortlandt family land was used during the American Revolution by both the Loyalists and Patriots, owing to James's leadership role early on in the revolution. On May 30, 1775, the New York Provincial Congress placed James on a committee to create a report on whether it was feasible to build a fort near his family's house.[32][33] British General William Howe made the house his headquarters on November 13, 1776,[34] thus placing it behind British-held ground.[10][35] The Van Cortlandts wished to stay neutral in the war, however.[10]  Later, the grounds were used by Patriot militia leaders Comte de Rochambeau, Marquis de Lafayette, and George Washington.[36][28] The house itself was Washington's headquarters after his troops were defeated in the 1776 Battle of Long Island.[35] That same year, Augustus Van Cortlandt hid city records under Vault Hill to protect them during the war, turning them over to the new American government after the war.[28][10][30] It was in \"Indian Field,\" at the present-day intersection of Van Cortlandt Park East and 233rd Street, that the Stockbridge militia was destroyed by the Queen's Rangers, and 38 Indians from the militia were killed in 1778.[37][38][39][40]  In 1781, Washington returned to the house to strategize with Rochambeau while their troops waited outside on what is now the Parade Ground and Vault Hill.[10] He later lit campfires outside the house to deceive the British into thinking that his troops were still on the grounds.[30] Washington used the house one final time in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris. The British had just withdrawn their troops from Manhattan, and Washington and George Clinton were getting ready to enter the island, stopping over at the house before doing so.[10][28]\n",
      "In the 1830s, officials in a rapidly expanding New York City saw a need for a larger water supply. Major David Bates Douglass was appointed to perform engineering studies on the future Old Croton Aqueduct in March 1833.[41][42] Douglass made estimates for the new aqueduct in 1833–1834 and John Martineau performed a separate study in 1834. Both found the proposed route, which ran through the present-day park, to be okay.[41][42] Thus, in 1837, construction started on the Aqueduct, which ran 41 miles (66 km) from the Croton River upstate to the New York Public Library Main Branch and Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan.[43][44] The project was built by 3,000–4,000 laborers who completed the entire aqueduct in five years.[43] The aqueduct's builders constructed a gatehouse within the present-day park to provide access to the aqueduct's interior.[45][46] The old aqueduct was supplemented by the New Croton Aqueduct in 1890, which also ran through the park. The Old Croton Aqueduct was in use until 1955, though the part that ran through the park was closed down in 1897 after the new aqueduct was connected to the Jerome Park Reservoir.[45][47][48]\n",
      "In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted was hired to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted the natural beauty of the Van Cortlandt estate, comparing it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property.[49][50]  Around the same time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881.[51][52] There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site.[53][54] However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house).[55][56] In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system.[55][57]\n",
      "Legal disputes carried on for years, exacerbated by the fact that Luther R. Marsh, vice president of the New York Park Association, owned land near Van Cortlandt Park in particular. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure like schools and docks; that everyone in the city, instead of just the property owners near the proposed park, was required to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction; and that since Marsh was trying to parcel off some of his land to developers, the park's size should be reduced in order to prevent him from profiting off park usage. However, most of this opposition was directed at the construction of Pelham Bay Park, which was then in Westchester.[58] Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens, thus justifying the citywide park tax; that the value of properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the commission had only chosen property that could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established despite the objections of major figures like Mayors William Russell Grace and Abram Hewitt; Comptroller Edward V. Loew; and Assemblymen Henry Bergh and Theodore Roosevelt.[58]\n",
      "In 1880 while the new park was being planned, the New York City & Northern Railroad, later the New York and Putnam Railroad, was built through the center of the park.[59] It had two stops in the Bronx: one inside the park, and another to the south at Kingsbridge. South of Kingsbridge, the railroad merged with the present-day Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad.[60] The tracks were used for passenger traffic until 1958, and by freight trains until 1981.[38][2] A shuttle train was operated by Yonkers Rapid Transit Railway between Kingsbridge and Yonkers. It ran off the main New York and Putnam Railroad line immediately north of the Van Cortlandt station.[45] Service began in March 1888 and ran until 1942 (see § Former railroads).[38]\n",
      "The family property was sold to the City of New York and made into a public parkland in 1888.[10] The majority of the grain fields were converted into a sprawling lawn dubbed the \"Parade Ground,\" while the Van Cortlandt House was converted into a public museum.[20][61] The construction of the Parade Ground required demolition of a few old buildings and cornfields.[62] The Parade Ground was immediately used by the National Guard for brigade practice, replacing the parade ground of Prospect Park.[63][64]  The ground received unspecified \"improvements\" in 1893–1894.[65] With the city's approval, particularly overgrown areas of the property were made passable. Wide walking paths were built over original walkways, including the thin paths that led to the Van Cortlandt family cemetery, high on the nearby bluffs. \"Certain lands\" around the house were then filled in for the purpose of creating a \"Colonial Garden,\"[66] which was proposed in 1897.[67][68] During excavation of the grounds, Indian artifacts and graves were found,[69] corresponding to the old village of Keskeskick.[3]\n",
      "The nine-hole Van Cortlandt Golf Course opened on July 6, 1895,[70][71] as the country's first and oldest public golf course.[72][73] The 2,561-yard (2,342 m) course comprised current holes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 14. The first eight holes were easier and less than 200 yards (180 m) apart, but the last one had a fairway 700 yards (640 m) in length. The ninth hole, which spanned two stone walls and two small brooks, was among the country's hardest holes. Four years after the course opened, the city hired Tom Bendelow, nicknamed the \"Johnny Appleseed of Golf\", to expand it to 18 holes.[71][70][73][74] The course added a clubhouse in 1902,[75] which also doubled as an ice-skating house.[76][77]\n",
      "At first, the park was sparsely used for sports. In 1899, there were 10, 7, and 5 permits issued for lawn tennis, baseball, and football, respectively.[78][79] The Parade Ground was converted to recreational use starting in 1902, when the National Guard added fields for polo.[80] In 1907, due to overcrowding, Dr. William Hornaday transferred 15 of the Bronx Zoo's then-rare bison to the Parade Ground,[81] where they stayed until they were shipped to prairie land in Oklahoma later that year.[82][83]\n",
      "The Colonial Garden, designed by landscape architect Samuel Parsons, started construction in 1902[67][84] and opened the following June.[67][85] Besides plants, the garden had rustic wooden bridges and wooden stairs and a \"handsome fountain and central court.\"[86] A \"Shakespeare Garden\" was also opened that year, with a grand stairway leading down to it.[87] The next year, park officials realized that the Colonial Garden's construction was of poor quality and hard to cultivate. The garden had to be raised 3.5 feet (1.1 m), and a nursery needed to be built to transport the plants during the garden's reconstruction. The rustic wooden bridges were to be replaced with stone bridges, while the wooden stairs were to be superseded by stone stairs.[88] Not only did many plants die during the process, but the actual rebuilding was delayed until 1911.[89] Two years later, the Parks Commissioner for the Bronx refused to allocate reconstruction funds because, he stated, the garden looked just fine. Under threat of tearing the garden down, the city had to find money to fill and drain the ground.[89][90] The rebuilding contract was awarded in 1909[91] and completed by 1911.[92]\n",
      "Various adjustments were made over succeeding years. A network of roads through the park was built soon after, allowing the construction of picnic areas and hiking trails as well as making the forests more accessible to visitors.[93] A stone memorial was placed at Indian Field in 1906,[94][40] with a plaque misspelling the name of the Indian chief, Abraham Ninham, as \"Abraham Nimham.\"[39][95] One particular concern was the threat of the wetlands serving as breeding grounds for malaria-borne mosquitoes,[96] which had drawn the ire of local residents and property owners as they believed the wetlands to be \"unsightly and unsanitary.\"[97][98] The marshlands were filled in between 1906 and 1922.[10] The marsh to the southwest of the Van Cortlandt Station was converted to a lake.[99] An \"outlet sewer\" under Broadway was built in 1907.[97][98][100] From 1903 to 1911, NYC Parks cleaned the 13-foot-deep (4.0 m) Van Cortlandt Lake, removed the original earthen dam, and emptied the lake in order to dredge the lake bed to a lower depth. A new dam was installed to reform the lake.[101][93][102] The former marshland was filled in.[103][104]\n",
      "During a 1910s excavation for a sewer pipe, stones were unearthed that were suspected to be from the old van der Donck estate.[10][105][35] During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers.[106][2] Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person,[79][107] and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year.[75][107][74] By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on a busy day.[108][109] However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.[108][110]\n",
      "The 6.2-mile (10.0 km) cross-country running course was inaugurated in 1914.[111] The track started out as a flat path, became hilly, turned onto a \"little spell of road work,\" went into the forest, and crossed a water before turning back. A year later, it hosted the Metropolitan Association of the Amateur Athletic Union's Junior and Senior Cross Country championships.[111][112] A modified 3.1-mile (5.0 km) cross-country course opened on November 5, 1921, with runners simply changing direction at the city border. The new course, which started at the original polo fields, did not conflict with either of the golf courses.[113]\n",
      "In 1922, there was a proposal to acquire land for the future Saw Mill River Parkway, which would connect the park to 424 acres (172 ha) of open space in Westchester when completed.[114] Through the 1930s, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation kept adding new recreational facilities in the park.[69] The Colonial and Shakespeare Gardens had a combined 250,000 flowers by 1931, but both were demolished by the end of the decade due to bad drainage.[87]\n",
      "In 1934, Robert Moses became the New York City Parks Commissioner,[115] and during his 16-year tenure as commissioner, altered almost every aspect of the park.[116] His job partially entailed balancing the needs of area residents, whose numbers had grown in the past decade, with transit users who traveled to the park from the north and south.[117] Moses's development plans in the 1930s called for the construction of the Henry Hudson Parkway and Mosholu Parkway to bisect Van Cortlandt Park and meet at a trumpet interchange about half a mile north of the center, merging into the Saw Mill River Parkway.[118] Due to objections over the construction of roads inside the park, the width of the parkways' lanes was reduced.[119] Tibbetts Brook was dredged and landscaped in 1938 to accommodate construction.[120] Such construction continued until 1955, during which the Major Deegan Expressway (current Interstate 87) was also built, bisecting the Mosholu Parkway.[119] This conflicted with Moses's plans for the park as a \"rural oasis\",[121] as highway construction ultimately separated the park into six pieces[120] and demolished most of the remaining marsh in the park.[122] This construction also induced siltation of the brook, leading to further creation of marshes.[120][123][121]\n",
      "Moses also made improvements to the park itself, building new walkways, paving dirt roads, creating playgrounds, and installing lights.[119] Baseball, soccer, and cricket fields were added in 1938.[106] The Van Cortlandt Stadium was added in 1939 on the site of a former swamp,[87][124] and a pool followed in 1970.[87] Moses also landscaped the areas near the Woodlawn and 242nd Street subway stations to attract park visitors from other neighborhoods.[125] During his tenure as Parks Commissioner, Moses took aggressive approach to preserving the park's quality.[126] For instance, six mothers were issued court summonses in 1942 after letting their children dig in the park,[127] and two airplane pilots were fined in 1947 for unauthorized airplane landings.[128]\n",
      "Around 1939, the old aqueduct, which was now a popular hiking trail, started becoming a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, there was a proposal to redevelop the trail as a bike path.[129] This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and Pelham Parkway between Jerome Avenue and Pelham Bay Park.[130]\n",
      "By the 1960s, large portions of the park, such as Tibbetts Brook, were being polluted by human activity; in addition, the brook now flowed into the Broadway sewer at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake.[120][123] Pollution from upstream and the highways, and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course, killed fish in the lake.[131][59][15] This problem was first noticed in May 1961 when thousands of dead bass, pickerel, catfish, perch, and carp floated up at the edge of the lake.[123][132] The mass-death of fish was blamed on siltation,[133] Three years later, fish were still being killed by siltation.[134] City investigators took water samples from the lake and found that they contained large amounts of weeds and sediment.[135] About 22,000 square feet (2,000 m2) of the lake's surface area was being lost to sedimentation every year.[136] In addition, an algal bloom caused the lake to be in a low-oxygen condition, endangering plants and animals in and around the lake.[135] \"Unpleasant odors\" in the summer also reduced recreational opportunities on the lake, and these conditions combined made it virtually impossible to come into contact with the lake's water without getting sick.[136][137] By 1976, there was a moratorium on all boating activities on the lake.[123][138]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Van Cortlandt Golf Course was used as a ski slope during the winters starting in 1961, and up to 3,000 visitors would use the slopes each weekend.[139] By 1964, with the use of artificial snow, it was also possible to ski during warmer days.[140] The seasonal ski slope was closed in the late 1960s when the city decided to allow golfers to use the Van Cortlandt Course during winters.[139] Also in the late 1960s, the city decided to build a series of public pools on the site of the Colonial Garden, consisting of a diving, a swimming, and a wading pool. Construction on the $1.5 million pools started in early 1969 and was completed by 1970.[141] Because of the swampy nature of the ground underneath it, the pools soon began to crackle and set. By 1979, the locker rooms were heavily vandalized and the diving pool had been closed.[142]The city's fiscal crisis in the 1970s caused the rest of the park to fall into disrepair.[69][143] A dearth of funds exacerbated the pollution of the park.[69] Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna.[136][15] Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.[120]\n",
      "In 1979, New York City Councilwoman June Eisland released a report on Van Cortlandt Park. The report noted that pollutants from the Major Deegan Expressway were entering Van Cortlandt Lake, and that the park ecosystem was also being harmed by inadequate drainage, soil sterilants that were used on the Putnam Branch tracks, and a fungicide with 8.5% cadmium content that was being sprayed on the golf course.[138][144] A year later, a private landscaping firm estimated that it would cost $4–7 million to restore the Van Cortlandt Lake. By this point, the lake was so dirty that a small boat could not float on it, even though the lake was 15 feet (4.6 m) deep.[145] Catfish were the only fish that could survive in the lake water.[146] The city of Yonkers eventually attributed the cause of the Van Cortlandt Lake's pollution to four storm sewers that were found to be illegally connected to Tibbetts Brook upstream.[147][148]\n",
      "The utter disrepair in the park prompted some informal rules at the park's golf courses. For instance, the Los Angeles Times noted that \"a player was allowed to drop his ball a club length away if it rolled up against an abandoned auto, or, in one case, a boat. To thwart robbers, besieged golfers quit playing in traditional foursomes and instead ventured forth in football-team-sized units. Some players added an extra club—a night stick—or tucked tear gas spray into their golf bags.\"[149] Years later, one writer recalled that dozens of the course's trees died, and \"flagsticks were reduced to broken bamboo poles stuck into the ground.\"[150] Weeds overgrew the course, and golfers would wear long-sleeved shirts to ward off against the city's insufficient mosquito repellents. Homeless squatters moved into the park, while courses fell into disrepair, replaced by dirt tracks and \"huts and forts\" built by neighborhood kids.[149] In 1985, the city licensed control of the courses to Los Angeles-based American Golf Corporation for 60 years, leading to their restoration.[149]\n",
      "Other parts of the park also fell into disrepair, such as Vault Hill, whose headstones and crypts were vandalized in the 1960s.[29][30] As early as 1962, a New York Times reader wrote of vandalism on Vault Hill.[151][152]  A lack of annual maintenance of the park's jogging tracks and bridle paths had caused them to erode and become overgrown at some places. In 1978–1979, NYC Parks performed a wholesale renovation of the park's eroded and dilapidated bridle paths and jogging tracks.[153] The Parade Ground remained popular, and the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera performed in the field during the summer.[154] However, it too had deteriorated because of intensive use: the grounds' topsoil had eroded away and the sidewalks started to buckle.[155] In 1978, the Perrier Company donated a fitness trail consisting of 12 exercise machines to the park; there were originally supposed to be 18 machines, but the extra six machines were deemed unnecessary.[156] Two shuffleboard courts were also installed in the Parade Grounds the same year, but went unused because of a lack of playing equipment.[157]\n",
      "In response to studies and accounts that showed the bad condition of the lake, the state restored the fish population of the lake in 1978.[101][158][131] In 1977, the Bronx Borough Board created a special committee to oversee and develop plans for improving Van Cortlandt Park.[159][160] The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park soon came up with its own suggestions to improve the park.[161] After the parcourse for the parade grounds was approved in 1978, the New York City Department of Parks promised to cooperate on the Van Cortlandt Park improvement plans.[156] The 1979 Eisland plan also detailed suggestions for park improvements.[138] This culminated in the 1980 appointment of a park coordinator who would start devising details of a \"master plan\" for the park.[162]\n",
      "In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration of the lake and forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction.[120][163] Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration.[164] Gradual improvements began taking place in the late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities.[165] In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a study to determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration.[166] Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures.[167] An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.[168] A set of tennis courts were proposed within the park east of the Van Cortlandt House in the 1990s; despite concerns from preservationists,[169][170] though the courts were approved.[171]\n",
      "The city built the Croton Water Filtration Plant, a drinking water treatment facility, under the park's Mosholu Golf Course. Plant operations began in 2015. The plant was needed in order to filter contaminants from urban runoff pollution in the Croton River watershed and protect the public from Giardia and Cryptosporidium, microorganisms which can cause serious health problems.[172]\n",
      "The Croton plant was built after a lawsuit was filed in 1997 against the city by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Justice and the State of New York.[173] The city settled the suit and a consent decree was issued with the condition that the city would build the plant by 2006.[174] The project experienced delays and ballooning costs due to objections from the local community, which required the city to propose alternate sites for the plant.[175][176] The plant was built 160 feet (49 m) below the Mosholu Golf Course, at a cost of $3.2 billion.[172]\n",
      "To lessen the disruption caused by the plant's construction, in 2010 the city used mitigation funds from the construction budget to restore the Van Cortlandt Park Parade Ground.[164][177] The Sachkerah Woods Playground, located at the park's southeast corner near the Mosholu Golf Course, was also built using Croton mitigation funds.[178]\n",
      "As part of the \"Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan 2034\", critical ecological elements of the park, such as the forest, the rural landscape, and Tibbetts Brook, would be restored, and the brook would be diverted.[179] As of March 2014[update] when the report was written, the lack of natural drainage points within Van Cortlandt Park led to the flooding of recreational areas within the park during heavy rains.[180] The park's paths would also be restored with the addition of three new pedestrian bridges; a playground; four activity centers, of which two would be outdoors and two would be indoors; a skate park; an athletic field; and three basketball courts built within the park. \"Comfort stations\" and food concessions would also be added.[179] The Van Cortlandt Golf Course was renovated in 2016.[181] The skate park, new playground, and path improvements were completed in 2020.[182] NYC Parks started renovating the Woodlawn Playground in 2021 for $1 million.[183] One of the pedestrian bridges, which would have crossed the Major Deegan Expressway, was postponed in 2020 after its cost had increased to $23 million; the bridge was canceled in 2023.[184]\n",
      "At 1,146 acres (464 ha), Van Cortlandt Park is the third-largest park in New York City,[a] behind the Staten Island Greenbelt (1,778 acres (720 ha)) and Pelham Bay Park (2,772 acres (1,122 ha)).[187][186][188] It has numerous attractions and features that are both recreational and educational.[189]\n",
      "The different parts of Van Cortlandt Park have a varied geology. The Northwest Woods and Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway have a steep terrain dotted with Fordham gneiss, a metamorphic rock that is very hard to weather. The Tibbetts Brook valley is set in Inwood marble, which weathers more easily. The east side of the park near Indian Field contains Yonkers granite, an igneous rock that mixed with Fordham gneiss as a hot magma before later cooling.[190][191]\n",
      "Van Cortlandt Park contains the Bronx's largest freshwater lake, the eponymous Van Cortlandt Lake.[189] The lake is 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.4 m) deep at various times of year, and has an area of 18 acres (7.3 ha).[192] The lake is used for recreational fishing,[193] as it includes species such as largemouth bass, black crappie, brown bullhead, bluegill, pumpkinseed, golden shiner, common carp, white sucker, and yellow perch.[192][194] It is fed by Tibbetts Brook, a stream originating in Yonkers, which runs through a series of culverts before draining into the south edge of the lake at approximately West 242nd Street.[23][131][195] There are efforts to daylight this south end into the former New York and Putnam Railroad right-of-way that runs through the park[180][196] as part of the park's faster plan.[197]\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no surviving documentation for the creation of Van Cortlandt Lake.[21] In 1699, Jacobus Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook to power a sawmill, creating a mill pond at the site where the lake is.[23][24][25] Later, he also added a gristmill.[21][22] The sawmill was relocated around 1823 and stayed in operation until 1889.[21][198] The gristmill was destroyed by lightning in 1901.[199] By the time the park was created, Van Cortlandt Lake needed to be cleaned, as cesspools in Yonkers had leaked sewage into Tibbetts Brook, which fed into the lake.[93][200] A 1903 annual report from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation mentioned that the lake had probably not been cleaned since the mid-18th century, and now contained a layer of \"refuse and vegetation on top, and an ooze two to three feet deep on the bottom,\" with qualities more like a \"semi-bog.\"[201][86] Cleaning of the lake started in 1903. The lake's original earthen dam was removed, the lake was emptied, and 30,000 cubic yards (23,000 m3) of deposits were dredged from the lake bed.[202][201] A new 2,270-foot (690 m) retaining wall was then erected along the lake's eastern shore, and a new dam was installed to reform the lake and to allow future cleaning of the lake without having to dredge it.[201] After the opening of an overflow drain in 1911–1912, which connected to the sewer under Broadway completed in 1907,[92][203] Tibbetts Brook was directed into the new sewer,[70][201] The construction of the Van Cortlandt Golf Course compounded the lake's dirty condition, and by 1912, the lake and brook contained significant sedimentation.[201]\n",
      "Nearby residents also disliked the wetlands near the lake, as they could be used to breed malaria-borne mosquitoes,[96] and were thus seen as \"unsightly and unsanitary.\"[97] In 1896, they proposed to fill the wetlands in,[204] and the infill proposal was funded by the New York City Board of Estimate in 1899.[205] Subsequently, the Parks Department proposed to dredge the swamp and create a lake in its stead,[206] but despite this plan receiving $70,000 in funding in 1906, it was deemed \"not feasible\" to drain the swamp directly into the Broadway sewer.[207][96] Another plan to remove the swamps in the park's southwest was approved in 1904. The plan was to build an athletic field in the southwest swamp's place,[208] but all swamp-infill proposals for this sector were rejected in 1917.[209] By 1922, there were 23 acres (9.3 ha) of swampland left in the park, and the Parks Department hoped to convert parts of it for some athletic purpose, but this required the New York Central Railroad to raise one of its bridges first so the swampland could be accessed.[210] However, there are no records of that bridge being raised or of the swamp being converted.[96]\n",
      "In its early years, the lake was used for boating, canoeing, curling, and ice skating. By 1899, the lake was used by up to 3,000 skaters on weekdays and 10,000 on weekends.[211] The ice-skating house, shared with the golf course, was added in 1902.[77] By 1935, the lake was used by approximately 20,000 skaters daily.[212]\n",
      "There are several old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree.[2][213] The forests also contain wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, bats, Eastern chipmunks, Eastern gray squirrels, groundhogs, gypsy moths, Eastern cottontail rabbits, striped skunks, North American raccoons, Virginia opossums, white-tailed deer and Eastern coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of butterflies can be found in the park.[2][213] In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss.[214] Its avian population during the winters has exceeded that of either Central or Prospect Parks; a total of 301 bird species have been seen in the park since 1875, when records were first kept.[215] Amphibians present include American bullfrogs, red-backed salamanders, and spring peepers. Also present in and around the park's waterways and wetlands are common snapping turtles and Eastern painted turtles, as well as red-eared sliders that were introduced to the region.[216]\n",
      "There are five major hiking trails in the park.[217][218]\n",
      "The Putnam Trail (1.5 miles (2.4 km), easy),[217] runs north through the woods to the east of this lawn and west of Van Cortlandt Lake, through the golf course and along Tibbetts Brook and the former New York and Putnam Railroad line into Yonkers, where it connects to Westchester County's paved South County Trailway.[219]  Previously unpaved, the Putnam Trail underwent a reconstruction project starting in August 2019 and was reopened in October 2020 as a paved pedestrian and bicycle path.[220]\n",
      "The rails themselves were overrun with weeds, but they were no longer usable by trains.[221] The remains of the former Van Cortlandt Park station can be seen along the trail.[2] As part of the park's 2034 master plan, NYC Parks undertook a project to pave the entirety of the trail through Van Cortlandt Park as well as a short extension to the south, making it usable for both pedestrians and bicyclists.[222] A construction contract for the paving project was awarded in October 2018 to Grace Industries, and it was completed in October 2020.[223][224]\n",
      "The Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway (1.1 miles (1.8 km), easy/moderate),[217] was created in 1968 when the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had bought a 26.2-mile (42.2 km) stretch of the Old Croton Aqueduct, for use as a walking trail.[43][48] It starts in Van Cortlandt Park as a grass-and-dirt trail[48] and runs north along the route of the old aqueduct.[43][44] The trail features vestiges of an old, disused brick tunnel that brought water to Manhattan, as well as a gatehouse for the aqueduct.[221] Within the park, the Old Croton Aqueduct trail borders Mosholu Golf Center and Driving Range, as well as the Allen Shandler Recreation Area.[225] Its southern end is cut off by the Major Deegan Expressway in the southwestern end of the park.[226] As part of the Croton Water Filtration Plant project, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection was given $200 million to mitigate the effects of constructing the plant. A feasibility study in 2009 found that a bridge near the location of 233rd Street was the most feasible, and would connect the two sections of the trail.[227] This bridge was deferred over lack of funding in 2014[226] before planning resumed in 2015.[228][229]\n",
      "The John Kieran Nature Trail (1.25 miles (2.01 km), easy),[217] which connects to the Putnam Trail, opened in 1987 and is named after local writer and naturalist John Kieran.[230] The path features 13 stone pillars, each made of a different variety of stone, that were tested for the facade of Grand Central Terminal during  the terminal's construction.[2][231] The variety eventually chosen was Indiana limestone[231] because it was cheap.[2] The trail hugs the edge of the Van Cortlandt Lake and Tibbetts Brook marsh.[225]\n",
      "The John Muir Trail (1.5 miles (2.4 km), moderate) is the park's only east–west trail[217] that connects the three northern forested areas.[225] It was established in 1997.[232] Various species of trees and flowering plants can be seen along the trail, such as northern red oak, sweetgum, and tulips.[233] There is a large, steep hill in the center of the trail.[232]\n",
      "The Cass Gallagher Nature Trail (1.4 miles (2.3 km), moderate/difficult) is the hardest trail in the park.[217] It was given its current name in 1984, named after a local resident who was a fervent advocate of preserving the park's environment.[234] Shaped as a loop, it extends through the rocky forests of the park's northwestern portion.[221] It was once a \"self-guided interpretive nature trail\" where hikers could observe natural elements along the trail.[225]  Along this trail, there is a \"thick undergrowth\" beneath a \"canopy\" of deciduous trees that date back centuries. However, logging and forest fires have killed some of these trees. Pioneer species, which inhabit the plots of the forest destroyed by logging and fire, include sumac and black locusts.[221] There is also an outcropping of Fordham gneiss, the last vestige of a giant mountain chain that used to run through this area until the Wisconsin glaciation.[221] The exposed rocks also contain mica and quartz.[2] There have been many sightings of bird species along this trail, such as those of woodpeckers, owls, quail and pheasants.[221] This trail repeatedly crosses a 3-mile (4.8 km) cross-country trail.[225]\n",
      "A bikeway runs east from the golf course's clubhouse to connect to the Mosholu Parkway bike path.[235] Some trail sections are a part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000-mile-long (4,800 km) trail system connecting Maine to Florida.[236]\n",
      "The Van Cortlandt House in the southern part of Van Cortlandt Park was erected by Frederick Van Cortlandt in 1748.[237] This house still stands, making it the oldest known surviving house in the Bronx.[238][237] The estate the house sits on was of major importance during the American Revolution. Troops from both the British and Colonial American armies rested in this house during the time of war.[40] The Van Cortlandt family owned the property until they decided to sell both the house and land to the City of New York in 1886.[237] Ten years later, the house was restored as a museum displaying the culture and lifestyle of 18th-century families.[239] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1967 and became a National Historic Landmark in 1976.[240][241]\n",
      "Near the museum is a 15-mile marker for the old Albany Post Road, which was relocated to its current position in 1934 after the road was rerouted.[242] In 1938, officials at San Francisco's Golden Gate International Exposition gave a 4.5-foot (1.4 m) walnut tree to the City of New York, who then planted the tree outside the museum in the place of another tree that had died.[243]\n",
      "Vault Hill, the family burial ground, still exists. Located 169 feet (52 m) above sea level, it is northeast of the Parade Ground and west of Tibbetts Brook and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course.[29] There may have been an unmarked graveyard for Native Americans and African slaves, which was likely destroyed when the New York and Putnam Railroad line was built. Another graveyard exists for the Berrian family, who lived nearby during the 18th century and were related by marriage to the Tippetts.[244]\n",
      "The Memorial Grove honors Bronxites who served in World War II and the Korean War. It is located by the road to the Van Cortlandt House, close to Broadway.[245][246] Created in 1949, the grove contained a tree and a bronze plaque for each of the 39 soldiers who were memorialized.[106][246][247] By the time the grove was renovated in 2011,[248] there were only 18 plaques left.[247] Restoration was completed in 2012.[249]\n",
      "Van Cortlandt Park contains Citywide Nursery, one of three greenhouses operated by NYC Parks. It grows about 200,000 plants each year.[250]\n",
      "The Parade Ground is north of the museum, in the western part of the park.[251] When the park was originally built, there was a law dictating that the Parade Ground should be vacated for National Guard use if required.[252][253] The field was originally used by the National Guard for brigade practice,[63][64] but this use was decommissioned by the 1930s, and the land near Broadway was converted to 17 multipurpose baseball, football or soccer fields and two additional fields solely for cricket.[254] Today, it contains 10[251] of the borough's 19 total cricket fields[255] and a Gaelic football field.[251][221] The cricket fields were renovated from 2010 to 2013 for $13 million. During the renovation, the fields were relocated such that they did not overlap with each other or with the soccer and baseball fields.[255] The Parade Ground also has other areas dedicated to various sports, including six baseball fields, four football fields, five soccer fields, and a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) course for cross-country running.[251][256] The Rolling Stones commenced their Licks Tour here in 2002, getting into a blimp from the Parade Ground.[257]\n",
      "The park is home to a free public pool, along with numerous playgrounds for children and areas dedicated for barbecuing.[258] The pool was added in 1970,[61][87][120] though proposals for such a pool date back to 1907.[97][259] It was designed by Heery & Heery architects and cost $1.6 million.[260] The pool contains a 17,280-US-gallon (65,400 L; 14,390 imp gal) wading pool, a diving pool, and a 380,000-US-gallon (1,400,000 L; 320,000 imp gal) Olympic-sized pool.[260][261]\n",
      "The Van Cortlandt Stadium was built by Parks Commissioner Moses and Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia during the Great Depression, and was funded by Works Progress Administration. It is located north of Van Cortlandt Park South near Broadway in the park's southwest corner.[254][262] The stadium opened on September 22, 1939, to a day of track events and a football game between Manhattan College and Fordham University.[87][124] It had 18 tennis courts, five basketball courts, six handball courts, three baseball fields, three football fields (including one in the stadium itself), three horseshoe pitching fields, a running track, and a bowling green, as well as water fountains and lockers.[263] In 1994, Mayor Giuliani funded a $415,000 project for concrete repairs to the stadium,[264] and in 1998, the 0.25-mile (0.40 km) running track was rebuilt for nearly a million dollars.[264] The park is the home of the Manhattan College Jaspers college baseball team.[265] In 2015, the Jaspers moved to Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, New York,[266] but in 2021, the Jaspers moved back to Van Cortlandt Park.[267]\n",
      "Riverdale Stables, located on 21 acres (8.5 ha) of the park, offers horseback riding.[268][269][270] In 1934, there were two stables: a larger one east of the Putnam Division near Van Cortlandt Avenue and 242nd Street, and a smaller one to the Van Cortlandt Course clubhouse's east.[271]\n",
      "The Indian Field has baseball and softball fields, a sandbox, picnic tables, tennis courts, horseshoes courts, and shuffleboard courts.[272] The Allen Shandler Recreation Area, renamed from the Holly Park Recreation Area in 1966 after a neighborhood boy who was diagnosed with a brain tumor in the 1960s and died at age 15, has baseball fields, benches, picnic tables, barbecue grills, and a comfort station.[273] Other activities available at the park include basketball, ice skating, and fishing.[256]\n",
      "The Van Cortlandt Golf Course, which opened on July 6, 1895, with nine holes,[70][73] is located centrally on the park grounds.[189][73] Within a year, the course became very crowded and disorganized, with crowds behaving poorly.[73] Rules were set in 1896, with golfers paying caddies 15 cents per round or 25 cents per two rounds. Only caddies with badges could be hired, and bicycles, baby strollers, horse-riding, and horse-drawn carriages were banned from the course.[274]\n",
      "The course was upgraded to 18 holes in 1899,[73][70][71] and the grounds gained a new clubhouse by 1902.[75] The new Van Cortlandt Golf Course was supposed to be \"experimental,\" and if the course was successful, similar courses would be laid around the country.[275] Other American cities were interested in building such courses.[276] The 1899 Bendelow reconstruction had rebuilt the course so that it now spanned 120 acres (49 ha), compared to the 55 acres (22 ha) of the previous course. The new course was now 6,060 yards (5,540 m) long, or about 3.44 miles (5.54 km).[277] NYC Parks reconfigured the course again the following year so that \"congestion would be prevented and accidents avoided.\" Boulders were relocated, greens were enlarged, and hazards were built in order to space out the holes.[278] A clubhouse was added two years later.[75] Plans to extend the clubhouse were rejected in 1917.[279]\n",
      "On July 13, 1905, Isaac Mackie won an Open Tournament at the Van Cortlandt Park course, shooting 152 and holding off joint second-place finishers Willie Anderson and Bernard Nicholls who finished at 157. It was the first ever professional tournament held on a public golf course in the United States.[280]\n",
      "In 1914, a second golf course, the Mosholu Golf Course, opened adjacent to the existing Van Cortlandt Park course.[70]  It is located at the southeast end of the park.[281] By the 1930s, both courses were being intensively used, with restaurants located near both clubhouses.[254] Around this time, six holes of the Van Cortlandt course were rebuilt as part of the Henry Hudson Parkway's construction.[282] Due to the Major Deegan Expressway's construction in 1949, there were plans to fill in 7 acres (2.8 ha) of the nearby marshlands so new holes could be built. A third of the way into the filling-in project, conservationists and residents called for the rest of the marsh to be preserved.[283] Two greens were eventually placed on the filled-in marshland.[284]\n",
      "In 2002, a First Tee course, for young golfers, opened at the Mosholu course.[285] The Van Cortlandt Golf Course and its attached clubhouse were renovated from 2007 to 2014 for $5 million. Prior to the renovation, there was poor management, dirty grounds, and \"a proliferation of prostitutes and drug dealers operating much too close for comfort plagued the grounds.\"[286] The renovation overhauled the course with such improvements as seven new greens and a new drainage system. The clubhouse received an infusion of historic golf artifacts from NYC Parks, including \"vintage photographs\" and an exhibit about the history of the golf ball.[286]\n",
      "Van Cortlandt Park is a popular site for cross-country running, owing to its miles of cinder trails and hills as well as its steep terrain. One legend has it that a cross-country coach thought that Van Cortlandt Park's tracks were too hard and instead went to the New Jersey Meadowlands to train.[257] Its courses are some of the most utilized cross-country courses in the United States.[257]\n",
      "Around the Parade Ground, known to runners as \"the flats,\" there is a track that circles for 1.5 miles (2.4 km).[287] Another 1.25-mile (2.01 km) rubber trail and the 3.1-mile (5.0 km) cross-country trail supplement each other between 241st Street and the city border.[288] Runners on the cross-country course typically run 6.2 miles (10.0 km).[38] They start at the Parade Ground and passing through \"the cowpath,\" \"the runners' bridge,\" Cemetery Hill, and \"the back hills,\"[257] using the back hills to turn back at the city border.[38] This trail, built in 1913 out of parts of existing trails,[289] was renovated in 1997 for $2 million, receiving a new layer of asphalt and stone to cover a tangle of \"muddy ruts and jutting roots and rocks\" that were breaking runners' ankles.[257][289] However, by 2013, the trail was starting to show signs of deterioration.[257]\n",
      "The park is used for the Northeast regional championships of the Foot Locker Cross-Country Championships.[290] The cross-country trail is used for the Manhattan College Invitational, one of the largest high school cross-country meets in the nation.[257] In 2006, the USA Cross-Country Championships were held at Van Cortlandt and organized by USATF and New York Road Runners.[291]\n",
      "The tracks are used not only by local high schools,[289] but also for many college races.[292] It is the home course for Fordham University; Iona College; New York University; and Manhattan College, located across the street.  The college course is five miles (8.0 km) long, crossing the Henry Hudson Parkway at one point.[293] This course was renovated in 1997 for almost $1 million.[257] The 1968 and 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championship was hosted by Manhattan College at the park. The events were attended by about 10,000 people, and the championship race was 6 miles (9.7 km) long. In addition, Van Cortlandt is the venue for the annual IC4A or Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America (ICAAAA) cross country championships.[292]\n",
      "On December 11, 1909, the Hamilton Tigers and the Ottawa Rough Riders (later of the Canadian Football League), played an exhibition game at Van Cortlandt Park. Sponsored by the New York Herald, the game garnered between 5,000[294] and 30,000[295] spectators as Hamilton defeated Ottawa, 11–6.[294] The Canadian Football League's influence in the U.S. did not change after the match, and no subsequent exhibition games were played  in the city. However, it was notable for being the first elite Canadian football game to be played in the U.S.[296]\n",
      "Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park. The earliest efforts for such a thing date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.[297][298]\n",
      "Though NYC Parks owns and operates the park, until 2019 maintenance was handled by two separate nonprofit organizations. Van Cortlandt Park Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization founded in 2009, managed educational and cultural programs, and maintains the recreational areas.[299] The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park, an independent nonprofit established in 1992,[300] provided educational programs and assists in the upkeep of the park's natural areas.[301] However, the two organizations have not had the same amount of funding as similar private organizations who manage parks in wealthier areas of the city. In 2013, Friends of Van Cortlandt Park only raised $416,612—as opposed to the Central Park Conservancy, which in 2016 had an $81 million endowment to maintain Central Park, or the Four Freedoms Parks Conservancy, which raised $8 million in 2011 alone for the construction of the Four Freedoms Park.[297] In 2019, it was announced that the two organizations would merge that June. The combined organization, the Van Cortlandt Park Alliance, would continue the programming and activities offered by the two organizations.[302]\n",
      "Early in the park's history, there were calls for a direct route between Woodlawn and Riverdale. Property owners in Woodlawn were calling for such a route by 1893.[303] A preliminary plan for the road was submitted to NYC Parks in 1894.[304] The Woodland Path, built in the late 1890s, was linked in 1902 to a new 2,100-foot (640 m) path on the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's eastern perimeter that stretched east to Jerome Avenue.[305] Another road was built in 1902, extending 5,960 feet (1,820 m) north from West Gun Hill Road to the city line on the park's north side (later Mosholu Avenue; now Mosholu Parkway).[305] It was completed and planted with trees in 1905.[306] A third, 1,800-foot-long (550 m) road linked Jerome Avenue and East 237th Street to give Woodlawn residents direct access to Jerome Avenue Line streetcars.[305]  There were also preparations for a fourth road, which would run north from Mosholu Avenue and then fork into two roads before entering Yonkers.[307] This fourth road, a \"driveway\" called Rockwood Drive that ran from Mosholu Avenue to the city line at Yonkers, was completed in 1903. An additional spur from Rockwood Drive diverged from the intersection with Mosholu Avenue, terminating at the train station.[308] A pedestrian passage from Jerome Avenue to Gun Hill Road, opened in 1905, also allowed more direct access into the park from Jerome Avenue.[306] These roads allowed park visitors to access more of the park via automobile, but also had the effect of separating existing amenities, such as the golf course and Parade Ground, from each other.[93]\n",
      "By 1906, increased automotive traffic necessitated the widening of Grand Avenue, which adjoined the golf course.[309] A year later in 1907, NYC Parks wanted permission to build a road from the Yonkers shuttle's Caryl Station to Broadway in order to alleviate traffic there.[310] In addition, Rockwood Drive,  needed to be rebuilt.[311] There was also a third proposal to pave a trail along the Old Croton aqueduct, which had already received a coating of fill from the Jerome Park Reservoir five years beforehand.[310] The New York City Board of Estimate received a proposal to connect Manhattan's Riverside Drive to the park in 1909, providing a direct route to the Upper West Side along what is now the Henry Hudson Parkway.[312] No new roads were built until 1929.[313] In the NYC Parks annual report for 1912, it was noted that the park's roads \"stood the strain well,\" but that constant maintenance was needed to keep the roads in good shape.[203]\n",
      "In 1929, Bronx Borough President Harry Bruckner put forth plans for the Grand Concourse to be extended through the park as part of a proposed parkway system.[314][315] The extension would go under Van Cortlandt Avenue, Jerome Avenue, and Gun Hill Road, going around Mosholu Avenue before taking the route of the Old Croton Aqueduct until it reached East 233rd Street. It would then turn northwest along Mosholu Avenue, crossing Tibbetts Brook and the Putnam Division before ending at the Saw Mill River Parkway.[316] There was pushback from the New York Park Association, the Regional Plan of New York, environmentalists, city planners, and other figures such as former senator Nathan Straus, Jr. These parties' opinions on the proposed extension ranged from rerouting it elsewhere to canceling it completely.[315][317][318] The New York State Legislature passed a law that would allow the Grand Concourse to be extended through the park.[319] Following this, there were calls for Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt to veto the bill.[320][321] Roosevelt vetoed the bill on April 17, 1929.[322] However, there were some influential supporters of the bill, including the Bronx Board of Trade and the Bronx Chamber of Commerce.[323] In 1931 they managed to get the extension built, albeit with a reduction in width from 182 to 80 feet (55 to 24 m).[324]\n",
      "By 1934, there was a large system of interconnected bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane.[325] However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state of neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path.[326]\n",
      "Highway construction in the mid-1930s further altered the park.[327] The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner.[328] Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned as an extension of Riverside Drive.[118] As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester.[329][327] However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended[327] and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway.[330] Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement.[331] Work on the parkway began in 1935.[332]\n",
      "Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue within the park was being modified so that it would be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year.[282] Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh.[333][334] When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it looked like a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.[333]\n",
      "World War II halted all highway construction. By the time the war ended, Moses had become a Construction Coordinator for the city, and in 1947, proposed the Major Deegan Expressway through the park.[335] Since community leaders had some objections to the proposal, Moses held a public hearing to discuss it.[336][337] Opponents of the plan stated that the expressway would carry heavy truck traffic, as opposed to the existing parkways, where trucks were banned.[338] In response, Moses promised to place landscaping on the new expressway so it would fit with the park's character. This revised plan garnered the support of three prominent Bronx politicians.[338][339] The expressway itself was widely endorsed, but there were five proposed routings for the highway through Van Cortlandt Park, most of which called for using the old Putnam railroad's right-of-way.[340] The city ultimately selected Moses's plan in 1947.[341][340][339] The 1-mile (1.6 km) link was projected to cost $30 million at the time (equivalent to $380,000,000 in 2023).[341] Environmentalists protested the plan after finding out that this construction would demolish 32 acres (13 ha) of the marsh. Eventually, all except 7 acres (2.8 ha) were preserved, with the remaining 7 acres set aside for the Van Cortlandt golf course (see § Golf).[342] The Major Deegan Expressway was finally opened through the park in 1955.[119] The new expressway ran along the rights-of-way of Grand Avenue and Mosholu Avenue, causing these two roads to be demapped.[339]\n",
      "Since then, there has not been much alteration to the park's roads. As of 2014[update], there are five pedestrian crossings over the Major Deegan Expressway, mostly in the northern section.[226] A sixth bridge near 233rd Street was proposed in a 2009 feasibility study,[227] However, in 2014, plans to build the $7.5 million pedestrian bridge were deferred due to a lack of money.[226] The next year, the city announced its intent to begin building the bridge at a cost of $12 million.[228][229]\n",
      "The New York City & Northern Railroad (later the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad) was built in 1880, effectively separating the park site into two parts.[59] Its two stops in the Bronx were in the park itself, and at Kingsbridge to the south; after Kingsbridge, the railroad merged with the present-day Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad.[60] The line had two tracks between the Hudson Line junction and the Van Cortlandt station, north of which the tracks merged into one.[343] The company foreclosed in 1887, and the line went under the control of the New York and Northern Railroad Company.[344]\n",
      "Beginning in 1888, another railroad, a 2-mile (3.2 km) shuttle service operated by Yonkers Rapid Transit Railway, was built to connect Kingsbridge and Yonkers. It ran off the main New York and Putnam Railroad line immediately north of the Van Cortlandt station.[45] There was an additional stop called Mosholu located in the northwest quadrant of the park site at Mosholu Avenue (now Mosholu Parkway). The Mosholu stop was designated as a request stop, wherein trains only stopped upon a passenger's request.[345][346][347] A railroad crossing next to the Putnam Division's Van Cortlandt Station was replaced with an underground pedestrian passageway in 1904 to allow safe pedestrian travel in the park.[348]\n",
      "By 1942, the railroad was already seeing signs of decreased ridership: there were 600 daily riders on the Yonkers branch, down from 2,000 daily riders sixteen years prior. The Interstate Commerce Commission gave New York Central Railroad permission to abandon the branch on November 12, 1942.[349][350] Subsequently, riders filed a lawsuit to keep the line open, and the federal lawsuit was heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who ruled in favor of the railroad on June 21, 1943.[351] Nine days later, the railroad abandoned the line. By December 1944, the rails were being removed.[352] The main line also saw fewer riders as the years passed, and on March B, 1958, with daily ridership numbering between 400 and 500 commuters, the New York State Public Service Commission gave its approval for the railroad to stop passenger service on the line. The last day of service was June 1, 1958, and the station was abandoned, the line now only being used for freight.[353] Conrail continued to operate the line for freight use, though by 1979 trains only ran twice a day, and hikers often utilized the underused train tracks.[141]\n",
      "There are two nearby New York City Subway stations.[354] The eastern side of the park is served by Woodlawn (4 train), and the western side by 242nd Street (1 train).[355] The 242nd Street station was part of the first subway line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company,[74] running along the current IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to City Hall[356][357] and later South Ferry.[358] The station, serving as the line's northern terminal, opened in 1908.[359][360] The Woodlawn station was built later as part of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line, opening in April 1918 as the line's northern terminus.[361]\n",
      "Bus service is provided by New York City Bus's Bx9, Bx10, Bx16, and Bx34 local routes and its BxM3 and BxM4 express routes. Bee-Line Bus System's 1, 2, 3, 4, 20, and 21 routes also provide service to Westchester.[362]\n",
      "Van Cortlandt Park appears in the Nero Wolfe detective stories by Rex Stout. It is where the bodies of several murder victims are found – Joan Wellman in Murder by the Book (1951)[363] and Simon Jacobs in Plot It Yourself (1959).[364] The park is also where the climactic scene of the 1944 novella Booby Trap takes place. The guilty Congressman Shattuck kills himself with a hand grenade after Nero Wolfe convinces him there is no chance of escaping justice.[365]\n",
      "In Sol Yurick's 1965 novel The Warriors, the meeting between New York street gangs called by Ismael Rivera, leader of the Delancey Thrones, takes place in Van Cortlandt Park.[366] In the 1979 film adaptation of Yurick's novel, one of the gangs is called \"The Van Cortlandt Rangers.\"[367]\n",
      "The park is also the place of many happy memories of Horse Badorties, protagonist of William Kotzwinkle's 1974 book The Fan Man.[368] In Philip Kaufman's 1979 film The Wanderers, a football game between The Wanderers and rivals the Del Bombers occurs at Van Cortlandt Park. However, none of the scenes were filmed in the Bronx.[369] Van Cortlandt Park was referenced in José Rivera's play Marisol as a place where neo-Nazis burn homeless people alive in the apocalyptic world of the play.[370]\n",

      "The northern section of Bronx Park is classified by NYC Parks as a Forever Wild nature preserve.[27] The preserve occupies 35 acres (14 ha) and is permanently closed off to development.[28] The preserve is mainly composed of a floodplain forest with eastern hemlock and hardwoods, through which several walking trails run. The forest is believed to be the only woodland in New York City that has never been cleared.[29] In addition, there is another set of ballfields called the Allerton Avenue Ballfields adjacent to the preserve. The ballfields are named after Daniel Allerton, an early Bronx settler, and consist of three baseball fields and a comfort station.[30] The Bronx Skate Park is located nearby on Bronx Park East between Allerton Avenue and Britton Street, near the northeast corner of Bronx Park.[31][32] Two playgrounds, French Charley's Playground and Frisch Field, are also adjacent to the northern section of Bronx Park.[25]\n",

      "The park has five entrances:[35]\n",
      "The main watercourse in Bronx Park is the Bronx River, which flows southward from Westchester County to the East River, running for 2 miles (3.2 km) through the park. The section of river within the park is for the most part a natural watercourse. The river hosts a diverse ecosystem with a hardwood swamp and floodplain forest composed of red maple trees.[2] A number of tributaries run into the river from both the New York Botanical Garden[36] and the Bronx Zoo.[37] The river, once a heavily polluted waterway, was cleaned up in the late 20th century due to an effort led by the Bronx River Alliance.[38][39] The Mitsubishi Riverwalk, a free public trail along the Bronx River that opened in 2004, runs along the eastern bank of the river within the Bronx Zoo's Boston Road parking lot.[40]\n",
      "There are three waterfalls in Bronx Park. The first is a cascade near the Lorillard Snuff Mill.[38] To the south is a waterfall of pink granite, about 12 feet (3.7 m) high, located slightly upstream of the Boston Road entrance to the zoo. At this location, there is a small island that splits the waterfall into two cascades.[41][42] A third waterfall is the 182nd Street Dam near River Park. It was formerly used by the DeLancey family, which operated a farm in what is now the Wild Asia section of the Bronx Zoo, but now consists of a Fordham gneiss dam with a fish ladder.[42] As such, the 182nd Street Dam was known as Delancey's Falls, and also as Lydig's Falls after another local family.[8]: 39 \n",
      "Within Bronx Park, there are two large lakes of note along the Bronx River. South of Fordham Road, the river widens into a small lake called Lake Agassiz, which is fed by two streams within the zoo.[37] The lake was described as being 6 acres (2.4 ha) in the early 20th century,[41][43] although in 1971, 3 acres (1.2 ha) of Lake Agassiz were taken by land reclamation for a new bison \"prairie\" in the Bronx Zoo.[44]\n",
      "A larger lake, the 25-acre (10 ha) Bronx Lake, is located south of Lake Agassiz and stretches for nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) through the zoo.[8]: 39 [41][43] It was previously used for boating, and a 1912 New York Times article mentioned that over 46,000 people had used boats in the lake in 1911.[43] The Bronx Lake used to have a boathouse north of the 182nd Street Dam, but it was demolished after the 1950s.[45] In 1983, the JungleWorld exhibit in the Bronx Zoo was built atop the site of the boathouse.[46]\n",
      "In addition, there are several ponds not connected to the river. Cope Lake, located near the Fordham Road entrance to the Bronx Zoo, is a pond that predates the zoo.[41][47] In the mid-20th century it became used by pelicans.[48] However, the pelicans were moved to an indoor exhibit inside the zoo in the 1990s.[47] In 2009, the Center for Global Conservation opened on the lake.[49] Another pond, Twin Lake, is located at the northern portion of Bronx Park, next to the Pfizer Lab in the New York Botanical Garden.[36] It is popularly known as French Charley's after a restaurant located there in the 19th century.[50] The scenic ponds were formerly a public area, but were confiscated by the botanical garden, causing an uproar on the part of the local community. The lakes had previously been a very popular winter ice skating venue, with free access.[36]\n",

      "Crotona Park is a public park in the South Bronx in New York City, covering 127.5 acres (51.6 ha). The park is bounded by streets of the same name on its northern, eastern, southern, and western borders, and is adjacent to the Crotona Park East and Morrisania neighborhoods of the Bronx. It is divided into four portions by Claremont Parkway and Crotona Avenue, which run through it.\n",
      "Crotona Park formerly belonged to the Bathgate family, a prominent landowning family in the South Bronx. It was created through the New Parks Act in 1888 as part of a boroughwide network of parks connected by parkways. The Crotona Play Center was added in 1936. Crotona Park was formerly 155 acres (63 ha), but the northern portion was cut off by the Cross Bronx Expressway in 1945, becoming what is now known as Walter Gladwin Park. After a period of deterioration in the late 20th century, several improvement projects were commenced starting in the 1990s.\n",
      "Crotona Park includes a 3.3-acre (1.3 ha) lake, as well as numerous recreational facilities such as a swimming pool. The Crotona Play Center, a national and city-designated landmark, is in the western part of the park. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, also known as NYC Parks.\n",
      "In the 1870s, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned a greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography. This contrasted with Manhattan's grid system, laid out during the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid.[1][2] However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.[3] Around the same time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881.[4][5] There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the parks' sites.[6][7] However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house).[6][8] In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system.[9][10]\n",
      "Acquired in 1888 as a result of the New Parks Act, Crotona Park is on part of the former estate of the Bathgate family, which owned large plots of land in the South Bronx. Alexander Bathgate, a Scottish immigrant, had acquired the land from his employer Gouverneur Morris.[11] At the time, the land comprising present-day Crotona Park was called Bathgate Woods, which was on a high point and contained woods and a pond called Indian Lake. The Bathgate family opened the area near Indian Lake to the public, and it became a picnicking spot.[12][13] The Bronx Department of Parks, in its 1884 report to the state legislature, noted the land as having \"indispensable requisites for a park\", such as a \"luxuriant growth of forest\" with native oaks, elms, and magnolias, as well as proximity to railroad lines such as the Third Avenue elevated and the Harlem Line.[14][15] Due to rapid urbanization, Bathgate Farm quickly became one of the few remaining greenspaces in the Bronx.[13] When the Bronx Department of Parks acquired the parkland, it originally planned to name the now-public parkland Bathgate Park. Due to one park engineer's disagreements with the Bathgate family, it was named \"Crotona\", after the ancient Greek city of Crotone in what is now Italy, and to distinguish it from the nearby, similarly named Croton Aqueduct water system.[10][13][14] The northernmost section of Crotona Park was known as Old Borough Hall Park due to the presence of Bronx Borough Hall in the park.[16]\n",
      "The park did not receive many improvements until the 20th century.[14] Indian Lake's perimeter was paved in the early 1900s, and an ice-skaters' concession stand and a warming hut were installed.[17] In addition, landscaping work was performed, and a new grandstand for concerts and ball games was erected.[14] Three hundred American elms were planted around the lake in 1903.[13][18] Two years later, an athletic field for the New York City Department of Education was built.[19] A bill was introduced in the Assembly in 1909, which would install a New York National Guard armory in Crotona Park.[20] The bill was heavily denounced by the public,[21] and though both the Assembly and Senate passed the bill,[22][23] mayor George B. McClellan Jr. vetoed it.[24] Crotona Park was expanded via land acquisition in 1907 and 1911,[14] and extra tennis courts were added in 1915.[25] A concrete wall around the lake's perimeter, as well as lamps and paths, were installed in 1914.[17] A \"farm garden\", to teach children about farming, was added in 1928.[18]\n",
      "By 1911, local landowners complained that the sporting events at the athletic field and bandstand were too loud.[26] They requested that the field be moved further within Crotona Park.[27] In 1916, several local landowners filed a lawsuit, calling the athletic field and bandstand \"nuisances\" that were not conducive to park operation.[28] Some of these landowners alleged that they could not sell their property.[19]\n",
      "In 1934, mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia nominated Robert Moses to become commissioner of a unified New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. At the time, the United States was experiencing the Great Depression; immediately after La Guardia won the 1933 election, Moses began to write \"a plan for putting 80,000 men to work on 1,700 relief projects\".[29][30] By the time he was in office, several hundred such projects were underway across the city.[31]\n",
      "Moses was especially interested in creating new pools and other bathing facilities, such as those in Jacob Riis Park, Jones Beach, and Orchard Beach.[32][33] He devised a list of 23 pools around the city, including one at Crotona Park.[34][35] The pools would be built using funds from the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal agency created as part of the New Deal to combat the Depression's negative effects.[32][36] Eleven of these pools were to be designed concurrently and open in 1936. Moses, along with architects Aymar Embury II and Gilmore David Clarke, created a common design for these proposed aquatic centers. Each location was to have distinct pools for diving, swimming, and wading; bleachers and viewing areas; and bathhouses with locker rooms that could be used as gymnasiums. The pools were to have several common features, such as a minimum 55-yard (50 m) length, underwater lighting, heating, filtration, and low-cost construction materials. To fit the requirement for cheap materials, each building would be built using elements of the Streamline Moderne and Classical architectural styles. The buildings would also be near \"comfort stations\", additional playgrounds, and spruced-up landscapes.[37][38][39]\n",
      "Plans for the construction of ten tennis courts, a new playground, and additional handball courts and baseball diamonds at Crotona Park were announced in May 1934.[40] Construction for some of the 11 pools began that October.[38][41] Of these, Crotona Park was the only location in the Bronx where a WPA pool would be constructed.[36][42] A 110-foot-square (34 m) wading pool had opened to the north of the future bathhouse site by mid-1935.[38] The blueprints for the Crotona Park pool and bathhouse were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings that August.[43] By mid-1936, ten of the eleven WPA-funded pools were completed and were being opened at a rate of one per week.[32] The Crotona Pool was the seventh of these pools to open.[44][45][a] It opened on July 25, 1936, in front of a crowd of five thousand; according to The New York Times, about 10,000 would-be participants had to be refused entry.[42] The center was composed of the 330-by-125-foot (101 by 38 m) main swimming pool, a bathhouse, and the wading pool to the north of the bathhouse.[46]\n",
      "In 1938, further improvements were announced for the 11 locations that had received new pools. About $2.87 million (equal to around $62 million in 2023) was allocated to the renovation of Crotona Park, including the sidewalks on the surrounding streets.[47] NYC Parks started rebuilding the baseball and softball fields and the existing athletic field.[48] Sometime in the 1940s, a brick boathouse was built along the lake to replace a previous wooden structure that had burned down.[17] In 1941, NYC Parks announced the completion of these improvements. In total, seven playgrounds were added, three others were rebuilt, and a children's farm and two comfort stations were constructed.[48] In total, between 1934 and the 1960s, NYC Parks added the pool and bathhouse, as well as five baseball fields, nine playgrounds, twenty tennis courts, four comfort stations, paths, and sitting areas.[18]\n",
      "At its peak, Crotona Park encompassed 155 acres (63 ha) of land. When the Cross Bronx Expressway was built in 1945, the northernmost portion of Crotona Park was cut off from the rest of the park. The northernmost section was still known as Crotona Park until 1987, when it was renamed Highland Park.   The name was changed to Tremont Park in 1999 and again, to Walter Gladwin Park, in 2020.[49]\n",
      "By the 1950s, Crotona Park had become the setting for several high-profile crimes, as gangs began to develop in the surrounding neighborhoods.[13] Incidents included a thwarted battle between dozens of teenage gang members in 1950;[50] a series of muggings at the park in 1954;[51] the beating of a teacher in 1958;[52] and the fatal stabbing of a teenager in 1965.[53] Additionally, in July 1960, a six-year-old boy drowned in the Crotona Play Center's swimming pool.[54] To deter crime, and especially in response to a murder in a poorly lit playground in Manhattan, Robert F. Wagner Jr. proposed replacing the lighting in Crotona Park and other city parks.[55] The project was completed by 1963.[56]\n",
      "Restoration work in the Crotona Play Center was announced in 1965 as part of Wagner's plan to restore parks, playgrounds, and libraries around the city.[57] Ultimately, these improvements did not occur,[44] and many benches and water fountains were damaged without being replaced.[13] The boathouse stopped offering boat tours in 1970.[58] In early 1971, vandals stole multiple electric and plumbing fixtures from the play center, causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage.[59] To deter future crimes of similar magnitude, the bath house's and filter house's windows were filled in. Nevertheless, the play center remained popular.[44] In 1973, to determine the feasibility of completely renovating Crotona Park, the city performed a \"blitz cleanup\" with maintenance crews from all five boroughs. According to one official, such a cleanup had not been performed previously because NYC Parks officials were scared of being attacked by area teenagers.[60] Around this time, surrounding portions of the South Bronx were being decimated by fire and crime.[61] One particularly egregious example was Charlotte Street, directly southeast of Crotona Park, which by the late 1970s saw the demolition of almost every building along its three-block length.[62]\n",
      "By the 1970s, Crotona Park and other city parks were in poor condition following the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. NYC Parks commenced a project to restore the pools in several parks in 1977, including at Crotona Park, for whose restoration the agency set aside an estimated $5.8 million.[44] These projects were not carried out due to a lack of money. By March 1981, NYC Parks had only 2,900 employees in its total staff, less than 10 percent of the 30,000 present when Moses was parks commissioner.[44][63] In 1982, the NYC Parks budget increased greatly, enabling the agency to carry out $76 million worth of restoration projects by year's end; among these projects was the restoration of the Crotona Park pool.[64] Work had begun by early 1983, and the complex was closed for two summer seasons while construction was ongoing.[65] The play center reopened on August 2, 1984.[66]\n",
      "During this era, other improvements were made to the park, including the restoration of the lake and boathouse, replacement of benches, and repaving of paths. In 1983, a volunteer ranger program was created to help maintain Crotona Park and other city parks.[67] Some $500,000 in funding was provided by the federal government toward the rangers program.[13] The nature rangers moved into the old boathouse in 1984,[58] but a few years later, abandoned it after their funds had been depleted.[13] In addition, three U.S. presidential candidates, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, visited the park, while Pope John Paul II said mass there in 1979. This helped draw attention to Crotona Park as one of the only large green spaces in the South Bronx.[13]\n",
      "NYC Parks continued to face financial shortfalls in the coming years, and the pools retained a reputation for high crime.[65] Crotona Park as a whole was also seen as an unsafe area. Violent crimes including the stabbing of a pregnant woman, a shootout that injured a child, and a man who was set on fire during a bike theft were all reported in the 1980s and early 1990s; in addition, a serial rapist reportedly frequented the park.[13] For the summer of 1991, mayor David Dinkins had planned to close all 32 outdoor pools in the city, a decision that was only reversed after a $2 million donation from a trust created upon the death of real estate developer Sol Goldman[68] and $1.8 million from other sources.[65] Additionally, in the 1990s, a practice called \"whirlpooling\" became common in New York City pools such as Crotona Park, wherein women would be inappropriately fondled by teenage boys.[69][70] By the turn of the century, crimes such as sexual assaults had decreased in parks citywide due to increased security.[65]\n",
      "By the 1990s, there was a movement to revitalize Crotona Park, led by figures such as Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, who headed the Central Park Conservancy's effort to revive Central Park in the preceding years.[13]  In 1996, an organization called the Friends of Crotona Park was established.[71][72] The two pools adjacent to the main pool were both infilled in the late 20th century. The diving pool was infilled in 1995 while the rectangular wading pool was modified into a hexagonal shape after the 1980s before being filled in by 1996.[73] In 1999, the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund allocated $1.1 million to the restoration of five city parks including Crotona Park, to be matched by funds from the city.[13]\n",
      "The park's nature center was reopened in May 2001, at which point a \"restoration and management plan\" was created for the park, which envisioned Crotona Park as a greenspace linking the surrounding communities.[58][74][75] In 2009, the lake was restored and a new performance amphitheater was opened.[76] A rehabilitation of the nature center was approved in 2014,[75] and the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning opened near Indian Lake in 2015, with a new two-story clubhouse and twenty restored tennis courts.[77][78]  NYC Parks also released a master plan for Crotona and Tremont Parks in June 2015. The plan called for the construction of a cafe, dog run, and skate park in Crotona Park, as well as the construction of connections between the parks.[79][80] The boathouse was restored in 2016.[81] A renovation of the entrance to the Crotona Play Area was announced at that time,[82] and the lanterns atop the main entrance towers were restored in 2020.[83] The next year, NYC Parks proposed reconstructing the roof of the Crotona Park bathhouse.[84]\n",
      "Crotona Park is bounded by Crotona Park West (also known as Fulton Avenue), Crotona Park North, Crotona Park East, and Crotona Park South (a continuation of St. Paul's Place). It is divided into four sections of unequal size by Claremont Parkway and Crotona Avenue.[85] The park serves the neighborhoods of Claremont to the west, Belmont and Tremont to the north, West Farms to the northeast, Crotona Park East to the southeast, and Morrisania to the southwest. Due to its central location between several different neighborhoods, Crotona Park is sometimes known as the \"Central Park of the South Bronx\".[13] Crotona Park also contains connections to Hylan Park and Crotona Parkway at the northeast corner and Walter Gladwin Park near the northwest corner, though connections to all three are poor.[86]\n",
      "Crotona Park contains 28 species of trees, as well as the Crotona Pool, the largest in the Bronx.[85] A series of asphalt paths crosses the park, connecting its different features.[87]\n",
      "Crotona Park contains twelve playgrounds:[88]\n",
      "Crotona Park includes several sporting fields. Within the namesake recreation center, there is an indoor basketball court, a gymnasium, and a community center.[93] Outdoors, there are numerous basketball courts, handball courts, soccer fields, and baseball fields scattered throughout the park. The southern shore of Crotona Park's pond contains a baseball field, two basketball courts, and four handball courts. The northeast corner of the park contains another two basketball courts, eight handball courts, and a soccer field. The northern shore of the pond contains two baseball fields and a basketball court,[94] as well as the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis and Learning, with twenty tennis courts.[77] Across Claremont Avenue to the west is the Crotona Play Center, where there are two baseball fields (one to the north and the other to the south), as well as a basketball court and two handball courts to the south. There is yet another basketball court at the northwest corner of Crotona Park South and Claremont Parkway, and a baseball field at the northeast corner of the same intersection.[94]\n",
      "In total, there are six baseball fields, seven basketball courts, one soccer field, twenty tennis courts, and fourteen handball courts. The outdoor fields are free for use by the general public, but some indoor activities require a membership.[94]\n",
      "Hylan Park is a 15-acre (6.1 ha) sitting area at the northeast corner of Crotona Park. Named after mayor John Francis Hylan, it is bounded by 175th Street to the north, Southern Boulevard to the east, Crotona Park East to the south and southwest, and Waterloo Place to the west.[95]\n",
      "Walter Gladwin Park is a 15-acre (6.1 ha) park just north of Crotona Park's northwestern section, separated from it by the Cross Bronx Expressway. It is named after Walter H. Gladwin (1902-1988), who was the first Black person elected to government office in The Bronx.  This area has been called Tremont Park, Highland Park and Old Borough Hall Park at various times; before that, it was part of Crotona Park. The park is bounded by Tremont Avenue to the north, Arthur Avenue to the east, 175th Street to the south, and Third Avenue to the west.[16] The park's most significant features are the steps to the former Bronx Borough Hall site and the circular paths around a former fountain site.[96] Walter Gladwin Park was renovated in 1995 and includes basketball courts, a baseball field, playgrounds, showers, and chess tables.[16]\n",
      "Crotona Park is on a high point in the Bronx. According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, on clear days, one can see the Hudson River Palisades to the west and the Brooklyn Bridge to the south from certain points in the park.[12]\n",
      "Crotona Park contains a 3-acre (1.2 ha) pond called Indian Lake.[97] According to NYC Parks, the name supposedly comes from 19th-century youths who lived in the area and \"envisioned Weckguasgeeck Indians sitting around the lake on the ledge of the rock surrounding their chief, who would be smoking the legendary peace pipe with newly-arrived Europeans seeking land to settle\".[17] The pond is also popularly called Crotona Lake.[17][97] Historically, Indian Lake drained into Bungay or Bound Brook, which then flowed south to the East River near what is now Hunts Point.[98][99] An amphitheater is at the southern shore of the lake, adjacent to a stone bridge that spans an inlet at the lake's extreme south end.[72] The lake is inhabited by ducks, turtles, and fish. The surrounding area contains numerous native floral species including tulip, black cherry, hickory, sassafras, and sweetgum.[10] As of the 2015 master plan, the lake had become overgrown with algal blooms and contained excessive litter due to its proximity to picnic areas.[86]\n",
      "Adjoining the lake's eastern shore is a nature center, a brick structure that opened in 2001 and formerly served as a boathouse.[58] The boathouse was built in either 1928[18] or the 1940s,[17] replacing a wooden structure erected in the early 20th century.[18][17] The nature center sponsors outdoor activities such as nature walks, species identification, and summer camps.[100]\n",
      "Crotona Play Center, in Crotona Park's northwestern quadrant, is the only swimming pool complex built by the Works Progress Administration in the Bronx.[36][42] Its main entrance is accessed from Fulton Avenue and 173rd Street, which provides access to the bathhouse and pool deck.[87] The play center covers 9.32 acres (3.77 ha) and includes a bathhouse that separates the main pool and the former wading pool. The interior of the bathhouse contains mirror-image locker rooms.[103] The complex was designed by Embury and Clarke with Herbert D. Magoon, whose plan combines Art Moderne and Modern Classical elements. The primary buildings are decorated with sculptures by Frederick Roth, including ibis-topped pilasters on the bathhouse and bas-reliefs in the sitting niches which are adjacent to the pool.[105][106]\n",
      "On June 26, 2007, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the interior and exterior of the Crotona Play Center as official city landmarks.[102][103] The commission had also considered the pool for landmark status in 1990, along with the other ten WPA pools in the city.[107][108] Additionally, the play center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 2015.[104]\n",
      "The main entrance contains a stair, spanned by a very large arched brick gateway overlooked by towers with glass-block skylights.[106][109] There are lanterns within the skylights atop each tower.[83] Along the arch are bronze letters spelling crotona play center. A cornerstone at the base of the north tower reads a.d. 1936.[109] The stairway contains brick sidewalls. At the top of the stair is a brick courtyard which is enclosed by a two-story structure with a second story balcony.[87] In the entrance foyer just east of the courtyard, there were booths that sold tickets for the bathhouse; the ticket booths are now closed since the bathhouse is free to use.[109] An overpass projects from the southern facade of the courtyard building, connecting to a brick first-aid station.[110]\n",
      "To the east of the courtyard is a rectangular building with two nearly identical pavilions to the north and south. The longer side is on a west–east axis (i.e. parallel to 173rd Street), while the shorter side is on a north–south axis (i.e. parallel to Fulton Avenue). The building contains a brick facade with semicircular-patterned and cast stone details.[109] The northern pavilion houses the men's locker room while the southern pavilion houses the women's locker room.[111] The western facades of both pavilions contain brick-arched window openings at ground level; the north pavilion has a balconet on the second floor, though the south pavilion has a full-height opening.[109] The northern and southern facades each contain seven bays. Each bay contains arched windows on the first floor, and a pair of half-story skylights where the second floor would be; the second-story skylights are recessed slightly inward within the building. The eastern facade forms the back of the building, facing the pool area.[112] The eastern facade is subdivided into six bays.[112]\n",
      "Inside, the roofs of each locker room are supported by arched concrete buttresses that run between the rooms' northern and southern walls. The lowest 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) of each wall is tiled while the rest of the wall is plastered.[111] The locker rooms each contain lockers on their northern and southern walls. Otherwise they are nearly identical except for differing placements of several window openings. During the fall through spring, these locker rooms are used as gymnasium facilities.[113] To the east of the locker rooms are toilets and showers for each gender. These facilities were arranged so that both the men's and women's shower rooms contained an exit to the southern facade at the extreme eastern end of the building.[114] The northern facade of the bathhouse's eastern end also contains entrances to a girls' bathroom, a mothers' room, and a director's office. The southern facade of that part of the building includes a boys' bathroom, adjacent to the entrance to the men's shower room.[114][112]\n",
      "The complex contains a rectangular main pool and formerly also consisted of smaller diving and wading pools.[87] The main pool is to the south of the bathhouse and measures 330 by 125 feet (101 by 38 m),[110][b] with a depth of 4 feet (1.2 m).[115] To the south of the main pool was a semicircular diving pool, which since 2014 contains spray fountains.[116] A ramp, underneath the overpass between the brick first-aid house and the Play Center's courthouse, provides entrance to the pool from Fulton Avenue to the west. Concrete bleachers are along the western border of the pool area, adjoining a retaining wall that separates the pool area from Fulton Avenue, and extend southward along the round edge of the diving pool area. The eastern side of the pool area contains twelve niches with benches, set into the retaining wall on that side.[110] A single-story filter house sits to the east of the main pool area, south of the benches.[117]\n",
      "The former wading pool area, now part of Bathgate Playground, is north of the bathhouse.[12][117] It is surrounded by a retaining wall.[117] The pool area, once semicircular before being converted into a hexagonal shape in the 1980s, was filled in by 1996. The site contains playground equipment such as swings and benches.[73]\n",
      "From 1996 to 2012, the park hosted the EmblemHealth Bronx Open, an International Tennis Federation women's tennis tournament with a $100,000 purse which featured players in the top 100, who used the tournament as a \"tune-up\" for the US Open which begins the following week. The Bronx Open also hosted the United States Tennis Association's National Junior Doubles championship for boys and girls age 14–16, an event which continued after the demise of the ITF event. Proceeds from the tournament benefited New York Junior Tennis and Learning.[118][119][120] The Bronx Open was revived in 2019 as a WTA International tournament, held at the park and hosted by New York Junior Tennis and Learning.[121][122]\n",

Seeking to create public parks in the Bronx, journalist John Mullaly (1835–1915) founded the New York Park Association in 1881. His efforts culminated in the 1884 New Parks Act and the city's 1888–90 purchase of lands for St. Mary's, and several other large parks throughout the borough, including three parkways. St. Mary's Park was named for a Protestant Episcopal church that stood three blocks to the west until 1959.[7]\n",
      "In 1903, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation granted the New York Central Railroad permission to lay tracks underneath the park, as part of the realignment of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad line. The 2,200-to-2,300-foot-long (670 to 700 m)[8] tunnel was finally built through the park in 1905,[9] and the former segment of the line was eventually abandoned, and the 1.2 acres (0.49 ha) occupied by the tracks were returned to the park in 1912. Parkland was expanded further by an additional .8 acres (0.32 ha) in 1968.[7]\n",
      "The park spawned numerous recreation programs in the Bronx. The borough's first playground opened in St. Mary's Park in 1914. At this time, the park also had a baseball diamond, two tennis courts, and a children's farm garden. In response to rapid population growth and residential construction in the neighborhood, three additional playgrounds opened in the park between 1938 and 1941. After World War II, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses inaugurated a citywide recreation program to provide places to play and socialize in cold weather months. New York's first full-service, indoor recreation center opened at St. Mary's in 1951. Designed by the architectural firm of Brown, Lawford, and Forbes, the building housed an indoor swimming pool, gymnasium, locker and shower rooms, and meeting rooms for classes and community programs. Murals of Marvel Comics superheroes were painted in the center in the early 1970s and repainted in 1991.[7]\n",
      "In 1996, a quarter-mile fitness loop and two additional tennis courts were installed in St. Mary's Park with city funds allocated by the City Council.[7]\n",
      "In 2006, the Parks Department completed the installation of synthetic turf at the park.[7]\n",
      "In a New York Post exposé, it was claimed that the park is saturated with drug needles, drug users, and is hence unsafe, with 21,434 needles found within the park between May and October 2018. Efforts to stop the amount of needles within the park, particularly through specially placed receptacles, have not been successful according to the Post, with just 163 needles being collected between May and October 2018.[10]\n",
      "Though St. Mary's Park is the largest park in the surrounding area, it was too small to have an advocacy group to lobby for the park's renovation. In 2015, New York City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito allocated $1.5 million toward the renovation of one of the playgrounds.[11] The next year, $30 million in funding was allocated for further improvements to the park's recreational facilities as part of the city's Anchor Parks program.[12][13] St. Mary's Playground West was renovated for $4 million between 2018 and 2019. The project removed fencing; renovated the basketball courts, swings, and spray showers; and upgraded picnic and seating areas.[14][15] A second phase began in 2019 and comprises improvements between St. Ann's Avenue and East 143rd Street, including a new amphitheater, plaza, and benches. The entire project is slated to cost $19.6 million. The renovations would be completed by late 2021.[16]\n",

      "Macombs Dam Park (/məˈkuːmz/ mə-KOOMZ) is a park in the Concourse section of the Bronx, New York City. The park lay in the shadow of the old Yankee Stadium when it stood, between Jerome Avenue and the Major Deegan Expressway, near the Harlem River and the Macombs Dam Bridge. The park is administered and maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.  The majority of Macombs Dam Park was not open to the public from August 2006, when construction began on the new Yankee Stadium, to April 2012.[1]\n",
      "The 28.425-acre (115,030 m2) park, prior to the stadium construction, featured baseball and softball diamonds, basketball courts, and football and soccer fields.[2] Portions of the park are often used during New York Yankees home games to provide overspill parking for vehicles in an area underserved by garages and other parking facilities.\n",
      "Macombs Dam Park opened in 1899, when the Bronx was mostly farmland.[2] As was typical for urban planning at that time, a large, central greenspace was set aside to ensure that the developing neighborhood would be livable and sustainable. This same type of development had already been thriving around Manhattan's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, among several other New York locations. Parks advocates contend that Macombs Dam Park is no less valuable than Central Park or Prospect Park, which are both in much wealthier neighborhoods. Macombs Dam Park is in New York's 16th congressional district, the poorest in the United States.\n",
      "Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 and the Bronx County Courthouse, two blocks east on Grand Concourse, opened in 1934. Most of the neighborhood's apartment buildings opened in the 1920s and 1930s, including many Art Deco landmarks that line the perimeter of what had been Macombs Dam Park.\n",
      "Bronx officials[who?] had promised that replacement parks would be built before the stadium project began.  When the $1.6 billion stadium was completed, residents had several new recreation areas, including ballfields on the Harlem River waterfront, about a half-mile from the former Macombs Dam and Mullaly Parks.  Other recreation areas are on top of parking garages where the parks had been; these will be closed on game days, which make up 81 days of the 183 days between April and September, to accommodate fans' cars.  The roofs of the garages, with artificial surface are counted as replacement parkland by New York City. Other replacement recreation areas are on the 9-acre (36,000 m2) site of the old Yankee Stadium. The above ground structure of the ballpark, built in 1923, was torn down, with the underground clubhouses remaining in use for the new parkland.\n",
      "The new recreation areas cost at least $150 million, paid for entirely by New York City taxpayers. By contrast, renovating Macombs Dam and John Mullaly parks would have cost about $25 million. The city's parks department will retain ownership of the land under the Yankees' new stadium, but do not charge the Yankees rent or property taxes.\n",
      "Residents and parks advocates had criticized the Yankees' changes to the neighborhood, which included cutting down 377 mature oak trees. They said state and federal laws designed to protect parkland from private development made this project unfair and possibly illegal. According to the city's Environmental Impact Statement for the Yankees' stadium project, several buildings surrounding Macombs Dam Park may become blighted when the project is completed. Opponents to the construction of the new Stadium were defeated and the Stadium officially opened on April 3, 2009, for an exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs.\n",

      "The park is named after famed English explorer Henry Hudson, who is also the namesake of the nearby Hudson River, Henry Hudson Parkway and Henry Hudson Bridge. In 1906 it was decided to dedicate a monument celebrating the 300th anniversary of Hudson's arrival in what later became Lower New York Bay. The project encountered multiple delays, but in 1909 the city obtained the money, and in 1912 a 100-foot (30 m) Doric column, designed by Walter Cook of Babb, Cook & Welch,[1][2]  was set in place, but shortly after, funds for the project, which had been raised by subscription,[1] ran out. It was revived by Robert Moses in the late 1930s, and by 1938, the area around the monument had been designated as a park and a  16-foot (4.9 m) bronze statue of Henry Hudson,[3] sculpted by Karl Bitter and Karl Gruppe,[1] had been placed atop the column.\n",
      "The park underwent major renovations in 1989 and 1995, mainly due to the efforts of local community activist Paul Cymerman. For his dedication and volunteerism, a small playground area of the park was renamed Paul's Park in 2003, the only New York City park to be named for a living person.[4] After his death in 2004, the local community continued his efforts to keep the park safe and clean.[5]\n",

      "Ferry Point is named after the Ferris family, who were 18th-century residents of Throggs Neck. By the 19th century, the area had developed into a fashionable public summer resort, which also contained large German beer gardens, to which the residents of Yorkville, Manhattan (then a heavily German neighborhood) arrived by steamboat service up the East River. The 19th-century steamboat landing at Ferris Dock on Westchester Creek stood at present-day Brush Avenue north of Wenner Place; the road to it bore the name of the steamboat Osseo.[3]\n",
      "The first house to be built in the Bronx was reportedly the Charlton Ferris House, built in 1687 along Ferris Avenue between Wenner Place, Brush Avenue and Lafayette Avenue. It was situated on the estate of Albert L. Lovenstein. Several other large and handsome 18th-century Ferris houses were built in the neighborhood, of which two lasted until the 1960s.[3]\n",
      "Commac Street was nearby and parallel to Osseo and later demapped as well. The city sold this 6 acres to be developed and it had become a truck parking facility as of 2012. Wenner Place terminated at Westchester Creek and for many generations was used as a boat launch. New York City cut off the access to this Creek as it sold off the waterfront to developers. Neighbors are advocating for a boat launch at the nearby east side of this park and a kayak launch on the west side.[3]\n",
      "In 1937, New York City acquired the land for Ferry Point Park in preparation for the construction of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.[4] The land had belonged to the Roman Catholic House of the Good Shepherd. The original 171-acre (69 ha) parcel was called 'Old Ferry' and was located at the confluence of the Westchester Creek and the Baxter Creek Inlet. Baxter Creek later became the East side of the park when it was filled in by landfill. In the 1930s, New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses planned a beach, bathhouse, cafeteria complex, bus terminal and parking field for the site, but none were ever built. The landscaped west-side parkland was opened to the public in 1940.[5]\n",
      "In 1948, 243 acres (98 ha) were added to the park by condemnation, bringing it to its current land area. The west side of the park was well utilized by churches, schools, and visitors from Parkchester, Castle Hill and Throggs Neck apartments. The east side underwent years of raw garbage Landfill under the authority of the Department of Sanitation (began in 1952 and continued until 1970).[3]\n",
      "Early 2000s plans for revitalizing Ferry Point Park included an 18-hole golf course and an adjacent community park and waterfront promenade were developed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The adjacent parks were design by Thomas Balsley Associates and the golf course was designed by Jack Nicklaus in collaboration with John Sanford.[6] Laws Construction built the community park, which opened in 2012, and the golf course, which opened in 2015. The Trump Organization received the city's concessionaire contract to grow-in and maintain the golf course and run the general golf operations.[7] In early 2021, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government would be severing all contracts with the Trump Organization, including Ferry Point's golf course, citing Trump's involvement in the previous week's storming of the United States Capitol.[8][9] The operating lease was assumed by Bally's Corporation.[10]\n",

      "The Puerto Rican Traveling Theater is a theater company based at the 47th Street Theater in New York City.  It was founded as El Nuevo Círculo Dramatico (The New Drama Circuit) by Míriam Colón and Roberto Rodríguez.\n",
      "It was one of the first Puerto Rican theater companies to be founded and is credited with kickstarting the Hispanic and Puerto Rican theater scene in New York. The first production by the company was La Carreta (The Oxcart) in 1953, written by René Marqués and directed by founder Roberto Rodríguez. Although the success of El Nuevo Círculo Dramatico was short, the spirit of the company lived on when Colón went on to found the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater Company.\n",
      "In the 1940s and 50s Hispanic theater waned, only surviving in mutual aid societies, church halls, and lodges for smaller audiences. In 1940 a Puerto Rican dramatist René Marqués began to develop an awareness of the Puerto Rican experience in the United States while studying playwriting in New York. After returning to San Juan, he wrote the play La Carreta.[1]  The story of La Carreta dramatized  a family dislocated from their farm and resettling into a slum in San Juan, and then to New York City. It resonated with many immigrant families who felt that their history, language and culture of the working class were represented in a serious dramatic form.[2] The play was first produced in 1953, directed by Roberto Rodríguez and starring the young actress Miriam Colón. The success of the play allowed Rodríguez and Colón to form the first permanent Hispanic theatrical group to have its own space, Teatro Arena,[2] located in Manhattan on Sixth Avenue between 43rd and 44th street. The group was very successful at the start, allowing many important Latino/a figures to start their careers and giving Rodríguez the title as the father of modern Puerto Rican drama in the United States. However, the building was closed by the fire department in the 1960s, and the company could not survive past its fifth year of existence.[3] Despite its short life though, it still had a huge impact on the Puerto Rican theater scene. Many new groups began to form, inspired by the success of El Nuevo Círculo Dramatico and another group, La Farándula Panamericana. Some of these groups include: El Nuevo Teatro Pobre de las Américas, Teatro Orilla, Teatro Guazabara, Teatro Jurutungo, and most notably Teatro Cuatro, which still exists to this day.[2]\n",
      "Though El Nuevo Círculo Dramatico could not continue, Colón went on to form the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater company in 1967 after starring in an off-Broadway production of The Oxcart (an English translated version of La Carreta) in 1966.[4] The Puerto Rican Traveling Theater company (or PRTT) performed in both English and Spanish, traveling around the boroughs of New York City[5] with the focus of bringing theater to those who desperately needed it.[6] Supported by a joint sponsorship from Mayor Lindsay's Summer Task Force Program and the Parks Department, Colón began by touring a production of The Oxcart through various neighborhoods,[7] often to audiences who had never seen theater before. The tours were immensely popular, drawing crowds of people.[8] The summer tours continued for years after their start, providing free, bilingual theater to different neighborhoods in New York City. After five years, the company gained a permanent location in the Chelsea district in Manhattan until Colón was able to secure a former fire house in the heart of the Theater District, where the company still operates today.[7]\n",
