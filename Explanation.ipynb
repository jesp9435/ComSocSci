    "Due to the apparent similarity the two networks created have visually, it is evident that structural analysis is required to further explain this spatial network. Furthermore, there sheer amount of edges make it impossible to interfere anything with certainty based on the visual representation of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The network density provides insights about the connectivity of a network. It is calculated by computing the ratio between maximum amount of links and the actual links of a network. The maximum amount of links in our networks are calculated by ((n+1) *n)/2, where n is 257, the amount of taxi zones. This measurement is vital for this project, as the flow of taxi trips may differ due to weather and it could explain the network flow. The network density for May 5th 2013 was computed to be 0.29, whereas the network density for May 5th 2017 was computed to be 0.24. This suggests that there was more connectivity for the day with no rain. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further investigate if the weather affects connectivity, both networks were checked to see, whether or not they were fully connected. If one of the networks were not connected fully, then the weather may could have helped explain it. Since both networks are fully connected, the largest component of either network is equal to the network itself. This also suggests that both networks exhibit the small-world phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the tips received my taxi drivers, whether or not it is affected by the weather. One aspect that may affect this is the averaged weighted shortest path in the two networks. This was computed to be 0.23 and 0.41 for the network in year 2013 and 2017 respectively. The 78% greater value for 2017 suggests that the trips during rainy days had larger tips. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assortativity for the networks is important to analyze, since the similarity of nodes in the network may explain the underlying structure of the network. In this report the attribute assortativity and the degree assortativity is investigated. In this setting, the attribute of interest is the the boroughs. The attribute and degree assortativity for 2013 was 0.03 and -0.35 , and for 2017 was 0.03 and -0.36 respectively. The values are roughly the same, suggesting that the networks' nodes behave similarily regardless of weather. The value of 0.03 for both networks suggests that there is virtually no tendency for people to transport within their borough. The degree assortativity coefficient of -0.35 and -0.36 indicates that high degree nodes tend to connect with low degrees nodes, but not to a great extent. This makes sense, as tourists are likely to visit similar places and transport between them, thus nodes of high interest will have high node degrees.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the communities were analyzed to provide some insights into how external factors such as the weather affects, what communites are formed based on tipping patterns and frequencies. In the network representing 2013, a total of 10 communites were formed, in which 6 of them only contained one node. The modularity of this network was computed to be 0.12, suggesting a weak community structure. In the network representing 2017, a total of 8 communities were formed, in which 4 contain one node and 1 community contains 3 nodes. This network has a modularity of 0.16, which is roughly 30% more than the network in 2013, suggesting that the communities in 2017 have a better community structure and internal connectivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the findings explained previously, the weather does appear to have a measurable impact on the dynamics of taxi trips and tipping behaviors. \n"
